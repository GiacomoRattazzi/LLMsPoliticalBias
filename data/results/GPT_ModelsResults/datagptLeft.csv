The United Nations last week announced the first-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons and began the implementation of a deal to combat climate change. As part of that 2015 agreement, dozens of countries have launched plans to reduce deadly emissions from power plants, factories and … automobiles. Even India, with 1.3 billion people and a growing addiction to energy, said it hoped to achieve its goals.
There is widespread scientific agreement that rising temperatures and ocean levels – a cycle undoubtedly exacerbated by industrialized nations – have affected both the frequency and intensity of storms. As the National Aeronautics and Space Administration put it: “ … the power potential of more intense storms is much more dramatic than the relatively small increase in strength. There seems to be a pretty good physical basis for a negative feedback, rather than a positive one, between climate change and the most intense hurricanes.” The economic cost of such destruction is reason enough to attack global warming with the kind of urgency that our allies showed when they negotiated the nuclear ban.
The U.S.-based group Clean Air Task Force, which works to educate people about the perils of climate change, noted on Sunday that the cost of cancer treatment in the U.S. is now $83 billion a year – but one twin smoking at a cost of $150 a month ends up costing the family $216,000 over the course of 20 years, versus $83,000 for health care with a non-smoking sibling. Actually, the alternative to not-smoking is to not allow your daughter to smoke in the first place. This fact-based kind of approach is the kind of experiment in attitude that needs to take hold all over the world, because our survival is at stake.",0.5020922347903252,center

To the editor: Finally, some good news regarding climate change. With the introduction of several bipartisan bills to Congress establishing a price on carbon emissions, we can only hope their momentum overcomes the climate change deniers so prevalent in the Trump administration. (“Think we can recycle our way out of the plastic crisis? Dream on,” Opinion, Feb. 27)
This should be no-brainer legislation.
Although carbon pricing is not a perfect solution, it may be the most efficient way to create an economic incentive for large-scale reduction of greenhouse gases. The accompanying border adjustment mechanism will simultaneously enhance U.S. competitiveness.
Here’s hoping the carbon tax resurgence becomes a nationwide revolution.

To the editor: Plastic pollution is a global issue, but so is climate change. They are linked by the fossil fuel industry, which produces the raw material for plastic.
We must halt drilling in our oceans and on public lands, or we will continue to produce massive amounts of both plastic and greenhouse gases leading to climate change. Oil and gas companies have planned for a future increase in plastic production, which would require more drilling, more oil wells and more greenhouse gas emissions.
We are already feeling the devastating impacts of climate change. Until we scale back the fossil fuel industry, there will be no way to stop the massive plastic crisis.

You're a Climate Hero Whether You Like It Or Not
Politicians who oppose solutions to climate change issue dire warnings about the real or supposed costs of taking action. But the international media organization Covering Climate Now, for which I serve as a contributing editor, published a story this week about how lives were saved around the world because we took action to solve climate change. I'm sharing a summary provided by my friend, DeSmog contributor and journalist David Korten, author of When Corporations Rule the World and other books.
Thanks to climate change, we know the doom. record high temperatures. drought that dries up the land and the food it can produce. Rising sea levels that spur wildfires, which reduce the electricity supply, and also returning to produce high winds, causing electrical networks to reduce the power supply and possibly shut down to prevent catastrophic fires. It takes leadership to navigate all that. Climate hero is a title that one stumbles into, more than one that is aspired to. Indices published and analyzed this week, though their ways of measuring and their objects differ, find that the U.S. is quite a distance from becoming a climate champion. Many people who consider themselves such were unhappy with the official response. We want to feel like heroes, and when our aspirations are crushed, we lash out at those we feel are trying to do so. Whether or not we like it, we are all climate heroes. We entered that role the first time we turned the key to start the gas-powered engine of her vehicle, or turned the dial to get power from the coal or methane powered electrical generating plant. The fact that some of could her afford hybrid or electric vehicles really doesn't gets us off the hook.
Under present conditions of extreme wealth and inequality, that is however the hard cruel.
The reality is that as Zeus guided the actors on the small stage above St. Valentine's stream to express the contradictions in the reality of love, so Nature/Society governs the action on the small planet Earth to express the realities of climate change.
As on the Greek stage, we are all players in the drama, the few climate champions and the many climate change deniers and the vast majority in between that check the box on the pollster's survey, but take few actions. The margins of choice for us actors are narrow. Each of us is limited in the effectiveness of action we can take and any feelings the satisfaction they bring. Many many actuating social, economic and psychological and making change voluntary in their person But the greatest leverage for changing nation and eventually global policy falls to leaders in a few pivotal nations.
As climate heroes, we can save lives. That communicating to those leaders and taking direct action, the most effective and rapidly they act, the more lives we save whether we're happy about it or not.",0.17619966513787708,left
Write a news article to describe climate change.,"what is the blue wave worth if climate change is ignoring it?.
What will a “blue wave” do about climate change? However much of it arrives, Democratic control of the House would certainly have more robust oversight of the Trump Administration’s determined dismantling of important US environmental protections. Leading congressional Democrats are vowing it would be followed by efforts to reduce the nation’s carbon output, but the difficulty in so doing shows up in the party’s loss of senate and gubernatorial campaigns in half a dozen now-Trump states that outlaw so much as planning for the very phenomena that flood and roast them.
And the problems the Democrats’ face don’t just involve Senate apportionment and gerrymandering, which give luck and the GOP structural advantages. As Jane Flegal and Alex Stark explain at The Monkey Cage, antipathy to climate policy is written into the Republican Party’s DNA, with the result that “over the past two decades, the culture war between the Democrats and Republicans has come to encompass climate change. The issue is now so polarized that what leaders and activists of one party support, their counterparts actively oppose. “ Thy note the “asymmetry between climate politics on the right wing and left wing in the United States…that helps explain why we have far fewer options for bipartisan cooperation on climate change than you might expect.”
What Democrats will do with the House, though, looks to me like slantwise, almost indirect, work. The big policy fix, a reinvigorated cap-and-trade system, are going to be nonstarters. “If I had my druthers, rather than jigger around with a hundred public policies to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, I’d suggest adopting a carbon tax,” writes Barack Obama, conceding he “long believed the most elegant regime was something called ‘cap and trade.’” In this anti tax-crazed moment of Trumpish unilateralism, much less Obama derangement, the bizarre effort to understand the “yellow vest” protests deploying what happens to gas prices under bigger pollution taxes seems admittedly stillborn in this country on the day its most lobbied state governor Jerry Brown—that's some 20 billion fossils a year—bows out. The Guv, by the way, still thinks “[t]he real driver is gasoline. We never even tried to get at it. We got at new cars, but the federal government has stopped at the sticks’ edge. So, there’s a lot more that has to be done.”
Specific policies aside, what Congress actually might accomplish on emissions is an enhanced rebuttal infrastructure and advocacy for adaptations primarily of coastlines to new sea levels and weather-resistant agriculture—especially if they begin by denying water to some. Policy will be aimed at people who so far think it doesn’t have anything to do with them, it’s a signature effort of the “I’m in the midst of some vast ecological disruption and don’t even know it campaign.” And it will move the country’s politics and economy one way toward reintegrating its pessimistic, anti-enlightenment political pole.

Write a news article to discuss rise in global temperatures.,"hottest year on record shows urgent need to modernize infrastructure.
2017 marked the third consecutive year with a record-breaking increase in global temperatures.
When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Water Resources Planning Act in 1965, he established the Water Resources Council and assigned it the task of creating a comprehensive overview of the nation’s water infrastructure systems, needs, and priorities. LBJ considered the distribution and management of water a critical component of our nation’s physical assets, an essential component of what he famously called “a Great Society.” It is only through prudent management of these critical assets, LBJ believed, that policymakers could prepare for a fast-growing American future and mitigate against the natural and man-made disasters that threaten it.
Half a century later, we face a new, existential peril. Carbon emissions and global temperatures for 2017 reached record levels. In fact, 2017 marked the third consecutive year with a record-breaking increase in global temperatures. The need for immediate action on climate change was confirmed yet again by the release of the government’s National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive report crafted over the course of more than three years by more than 300 leading scientists and academic experts from 13 federal agencies. As the report states, “Based on extensive evidence, it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”
It was against this backdrop that, precisely 50 years after the Water Resources Planning Act, in October 2015, the RiverRegion of the Metropolitan Planning Council, the San Francisco-based Center for Climate Strategies, and the University of Idaho convened the Metropolitan Planning Organization Policy Innovation Exchange, bringing together seven U.S. experts to explore the specific threats from (and solutions to) climate change that the members of the U.S. Network of Metropolitan Planning Organizations face in particular. Some have to worry about rising sea levels and coastal flooding. For others, the biggest threat is drought. For still others, it's how a changing climate will inform the evacuation of vulnerable seniors and low-income workers either before or after an extreme weather event. This is one prickly, not so little thorn in the side of United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change objective that calls upon nearly 200 signatory governments to bring their national climate proposals to the table in Paris next week.",0.3615565846363703,left

The strongest El Niño in a few decades is making its presence known and isn’t calming at all with an even more elevated global temperature predicted in 2016. This may mean that the increased temperatures, melting ice, melting permafrost and a thousand other methods by which we change the planet’s delicate climatic conditions could become even more pronounced as the year rolls along.
Condemning this year, 2016, as a loss would be a mistake however. While we continue the fight against our late salvation, there is an innocent asteroid at our fingertips and its presence is going un-celebrated by the masses. Only the social media illuminate the small rock floating out in space awaiting human interaction. Asteroid 2016 CA will fly as near as 3 million miles to Earth and then again The Earth will come close to the latest intruder in April.

Only 9 others made it closer to Earth’s atmosphere, re-entering the atmosphere before reaching the Earth but the end result is a ball of fire lighting up the night sky in a delicately beautiful and sometimes destructive ballet.

Social media may have been created merely as a means of flaunting the minutiae of our activity to the universe but it seems only genuine news travels but this speeds towards a cooler climate. While wind farms, climate talks, solar fields and EV’s get their share of exposure this single minor asteroid makes the humble .6 mile wide rock 100 million miles away from the sun orbiting at a slow opening velocity which is about to show us its dance is just something to gawk at.
Elon Musk’s hyperloop in its current fashion may never succeed but the possibility has been realized. 2016 will be a trying year when it seems that there may not be tremendous openings in innovation but it serves as a reminder to keep searching; there is an infinite amount of information to be gained by exploration. The seemingly unsolvable problems of the world have tiny blips of hope floating millions of miles out in space and in their reach is an renewable climate change reform.

Write a news article to highlight rise in global temperatures.,"today is earth's hottest day of the decade so far. here's the story of climate change so far this year..
In Spain, record temperatures in both June and July with a top high of 108.7°F on July 13 in Coimbra. In the US, it was the second-hottest month ever recorded. The state of California had its hottest month on record. And we've just had the hottest day of the decade in many places in the southern and eastern US, including New York City, Boston, and Chicago.
The earth's steadily warming climate is making these extreme temperatures grow ever more common. Researchers say that by now, today is the hottest it's been all year. And the hottest day of the year in the future won't just be the very hottest day of the year in the past; it's likely to be much worse. Simply put, the planet is heating up.
Every year, we're seeing more and more record-breaking temperatures. What people in the southern and eastern US felt today offers a glimpse of what people in even cooler locations could feel in the future: astronomically scalding temperatures, and the increased chance of heat waves and drought.
Scientists say that in order to prevent many more days like this one going forward, we have to phase out fossil fuels as quickly as possible. The plan has to include an increased reliance in renewable energy, new technology, and a change in everyday habits that create carbon emissions (like driving fuel-efficient vehicles, walking and biking to work, using more public transportation, and living in towns with Nature Conservancy-preserved green spaces.)",0.29959877332051593,left

Climate Change Made Recent Record Breaking Global Temperatures 600 Times More Likely, Scientists Find
On Monday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its annual report tracking the record-smashing climate benchmarks the world hit in 2016 . It found that the planet saw “the highest annual combined temperature and greenhouse gas levels on record.”
University of Melbourne climate scientist Andrew King has now put that work into context. Every one of the climate records set in 2016 had one thing in common, he found: They wouldn’t have been possible without humanity’s influence on the climate.
In a study released late Wednesday, King calculated the odds of those temperature records falling in the world that was, and the world that wasn’t ― and warned that even greater, potentially deadly warming could soon be described as normal.
“In many places we will pass well beyond the climate that we have in the last million years on this planet.”
- Michael Mann, Pennsylvania State University
“We find that global record counts for 2016 would have been extremely unlikely without climate change, suggesting that these events would have had negligible to zero probability in a world not altered by human activities,” King wrote.
The heat that bolstered the above- and below-sea-surface temperatures that fueled the world’s third-worst global coral bleaching epidemic also drove the unprecedented, unexpected warmth that eroded the Earth’s boreal and temperate mountain and low-land permafrost.
Likewise, the Peasant farmer Regis from the village of Thibe in the Shewa province in central Senegal, walks through one of the sites that used to be the Lake Guiers, Africa's sixth-largest natural lake, December 2, 2011. REUTERS/Finbarr O'Reilly - Residents near Senegal’s Lake Guiers, the source of drinking water for nearly 42 percent of the country, say shrinking water levels are literally reshaping the ground beneath their feet. They blame a dry spell, but they fear that global warming is also affecting the lake.
Record-breaking atmospheric anger in the northern Hemisphere spring from climate change sparked the wildfires that raged across boreal forests; warmer waters sliced into the Arctic sea ice, leading it to shrink to its lowest extent on record.
“All these events, they really will bear the footprints of climate change for decades, centuries,” University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd told HuffPost. “We should be making sure that we don’t continue the very thing that got us here.”
Both King and Shepherd were quick to note that no seasonal or singular weather event is tied directly to climate change. Nor did King assert that the flooding in places like Louisiana or India or even the high number of rain bombs that marked spring 2016 storms resulted from humanity’s pollution. Still, there were trends that suggest global warming played a substantial roll in the downpour onslaught, King wrote.
“If you take the big picture and connect the dots, if you will, some of those extremes were made more likely by climate change,” King told HuffPost. “There are a number of climate change signals you can see in 2016. The climate change component made a variety of temperature and rainfall extremes more likely.”
Last month, a group of American scientists found that 2016 would have been the warmest year on record ― even if half the planet cooled by a full degree Celsius. The King study bolsters that argument, particularly given that only a relatively small part of Earth needs to warm for extreme weather like rain bombs to hit regions far outside the initial impact area. The storm that sparked Louisiana’s worst flooding in two centuries began as a subtropical system over the Florida Panhandle. Flooding from rain bombs across Houston in April reflected months of warming in the Texas spring.
While Shepherd praised the study, predicting the weather will be bolstered as climate scientists refine models. Caring for an increasingly variable and extreme weather environment, he said, starts with recognition that climate change is real and already having observable impacts.
“The potential that connections with climate were really there in how we perceived 2016 happened to be true,” Shepherd said. “Presumably decades ago, we just need to have a serious conversation about that fact already happening.”",0.49915372619094944,center

For Kim Jenkins, who has a master’s degree in fashion research from the New School , that means “we should really be rethinking the whole model” of design development and, specifically, how garment sewers are compensated.

On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) published a report predicting above normal temperatures for the contiguous U.S. through October. For the next five days, though? All the agency’s willing to say is that it’s going to be fucking hot.
America is currently in the throes of yet another “heat dome.” High pressure centered over the central and southern plains is forecast to move east over the next 48 hours, unleashing temperatures anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees above average in the eastern U.S., including the Central Atlantic and the Midwest. With accompanying humidity, heat index values could climb to close to 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
On my phone, the Noaa alerts that used to ping mostly for destructive storms and tornadoes instead are filled with the word of the season: EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING.
This is just regular bad hot, though. Meteorologists are rolling out their concerns over this bout of extreme heat, warning that it has the potential to be life-threatening. The National Weather Service, as well as health officials in major cities like Philadelphia and Chicago, are urging people to “stay hydrated and take precautions to avoid heat illness” and “reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or evening.”

Simply put, it’s goddamn hot and the reality is this is going to be the new normal. The Arctic is on fire and on Wednesday came news that June 2019 was the hottest on record.

By 2050, there will be one every other year.

Average polar melting is locking in long-term sea level rises that now guarantee the low-lying coastal land will be lost – even if the 2015 Paris agreement to limit climate catastrophe is met – according to the international team of researchers.
Districts in some of the world’s most global cities are under intense threat from the highest kind of flood risk, with new analysis showing that major international economic centres are currently “in dangerous transition” of extreme weather formed due to changing polar temperatures.
Countries described by the paper as green see sea level increases above the global average and risk more severe coastal flooding.
The research has prompted a strong response from the United Nations climate team, with a warning that the stark realities “the fire has now been lit”.
The study estimates that the combined climate impact of historical emissions and melting ice is worth $27tn of that risk, and evaluates major cities around the world.
By 2070 – in the scenarios where Paris is missed – the paper finds 5 to 10 centimetres greater global average sea level rise would lead to 48 and 62 respectively to unlivable land area and population.

Climate scientists are struggling to find the right words for very bad news.
A few scientists want to dust off an idea from the 1960s, when the effects of greenhouses gases first started nagging at researchers. The apocalyptic risk: That the Arctic permafrost will emit a huge burst of greenhouse gases — enough to heat the planet by 18 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). This “de-gassing” would continue upwards of 100 years and the sudden release would spell disaster for life on the planet.
Grave as the threat of terrorist attacks, he said, his research has led him to envision the possibility of a bleak “end of science” future.
I believe it’s time for climate scientists to make like the medical profession and give up parsing words simply to subcontract the task of scaring the bejesus out of the rest of us to special-psyches. Solutions prescribed by psyches may include more ambitious carbon pricing, carbon dioxide removal technologies, and, of course, way-cool nukes.

Why is the Green New Deal so controversial?

Sheila Bowman, the managing director of the Seafood Watch program at California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium, is a pleasant-sounding example of an individual who has been known to chew into some renewable energy and leave high-carb environmental concerns out of the bowl.
She has rope climbed carbon offsets. She even has eaten tofu- not just once or twice on Tuesdays or Thursdays, but every other lunch- for years. At night, she dines by candlelight to collect micro-plastic for her three plastic-addicted pet sea turtles, Bob, Grey, and Harry, all of whom, I’m sure you know, fully expect to develop UFC-like abilities to be reincarnated as mutant sea turtles once the climate-apocalypse begins.
That’s probably not fair to Bowman, who really has walked the walk. She’s built as many Green Football Fields as any other environmentalist over the last twenty years while working with Monterey Bay Aquarium. Bowman was also known to sign any petition which an intern in the program wanted signed- at least until the Green New Deal began inciting a kind of blasphemous urge to stir coconut oil into lobsters at the aquarium’s restaurant.
Is it possible she has been walking a bit differently in the same direction- a left turn? I hope so.
Instead of imagining that such a thing couldn’t be happening in America- we certainly don’t have snacks, I mean “cracks” like the French bloodsuckers we so DNAly detest- we all might take a moment and attempt to consider how any version of swallowing the Green New Deal could be right and how it could be disgusting. It’s a mere thought experiment for an absurd proposal on the other side of the universe. It’s so remote that it’s basically a folk-lore version of “cursed earth” everywhere.
In fact, “Cursed Earth” is exactly the text depicted – in excruciatingly micro-printed font! – on the banner (the program is off the rails when you need those who would simply read a plan for the country to go Donald Trelawnsy on props) displayed above Alex and Elwood when they pop into an Ohio dive to grab a drink on Comedy Central or The Young Turks or 60 Minutes, depending on your cable plan. Just do a search for experts discussing smart, ambitious proposals for a modern America and you’ll find the right channel.

Liberia agrees deal with donors to pay illegal logging fines Read more
Deforestation spares no country in West Africa, experts on climate change say. The latest studies show 4,000 hectares of forests are cleared every year in Liberia for subsistence agriculture. On the Guinean border, huge mansions are being built where the trees were cleared, their size and value investing a sense of permanency to the invasion.
That gives the Pas officers with machetes and shotguns courage about venturing out with only a seat on the back of a jouncing motorbike to shield them. Clement, the 28-year-old from Monrovia, said he plans to use money from this contract to build a second room and enlarge his motorbike.
Still, the $11.5m is a long way between what Liberia got from logging in the past and what it needs now. So the government is also counting on help from the Kennedy school researchers of the Belfer Centre.
They have already saved Liberia $6m, Rapp said, by paring away 3,000 “phantom workers” from the government payroll. Now the researchers are focusing on ways to shake more money from corporate entities that declared bankruptcy and stripped assets from the forest.
But Anthony Ríos, the Costa Rica project manager for the Karspark Conservation and Encouragement Fund, who practices “biomimicry” and wears a necklace of red seeds at his throat – “monkey food”, he joked – cautioned Liberians to be patient and cunning. Everything he has done has taken 10 years, he said. Everything he has done has required him to take a lower fee so as to benefit the creature in the trees. “The forest is where the community lives. The community is the forest” that needs to be preserved, Ríos said.
“When the community comes to cut down a tree for market, you tell them it’s worth nothing. But then you put a door on its base and change it into a closet worth $1,500. That’s something somebody needs for their home. But if you can take a chainsaw and carve a story into the tree as a totem, a religious icon, now you can charge $50,000 for the tree.”",0.16902597485265383,left

To the editor: Thank you for bringing the tragedy of the clear-cutting of carbon-sequestering older trees in the Plumas National Forest (“ Logging is the answer to fire, disease, lawsuits,” Nov. 16).
Logger Hallwood’s statement that”there are big trees out there, we didn’t pick every single spot,” eviscerates his company’s credibility. Harvesting in the Sierra Nevada that does not involve clear cutting has very few impacts, most notably protecting older growth and relieving fire hazard. There is no excuse to clear cut existing, resilient, interests-in-the-ground, high-carbon-storing, incipient meadows.
Of course fire risk reduction does not come cheap. Government bore most of the cost of clearing along the highway between Ojai and Ventura. This is exactly where taxpayer dollars should go protecting existing homes to reduce risks.
We need to replace awareness of state-ownership in the forest with vigilance. The logging companies extract a resource with zero long-term planning and purely private benefit in the myopic form of profit. We need more protection for our forests, the lungs and heat absorption centers of all Earth’s ecosystems.

On Saturday, Brazilians marched in the streets to call attention to the crisis, and when Mr. Bolsonaro sneered at “the scent of gunpowder” that he said was typical of the leftist leader in France, Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg who leads the European Union, called his remarks “sad” and “discouraging.”
Within Brazil, Mr. Bolsonaro claimed his environmental critics were really after the vast resources of Amazon, responsible for 20 percent of the oxygen in the planet’s atmosphere, and said he would send troops to the forests to stop the blazes. But that drew an unusually pointed critique from a former Brazilian minister of the armed forces, Nelson Jobim, a onetime justice minister who in 1977 was a prosecutor in a trial of political prisoners held responsible for beginning a major forest fire, at that time the worst in the country since the 1940s.
“The armed forces don’t have the mission to use the armed forces for this purpose,” Mr. Jobim told the journal Valor Economico . “It is not their job, not their prerogative according to public policy. They’re not trained to carry out this kind of activity.” The real mission of troops, he said, were “threats, attacks, confrontations, disputes this is a very delicate thing.”

The latter apparently blown a record bullying fageda of mea culpas by Brazil President Jair Bolsonario whose populist stance was denied the virus in spite of record statistics.

Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has increased by almost 64% in April, compared to the same month last year, reported the country’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) this Friday.
The numbers are even more alarming in the Legal Amazon as a whole: a 46% increase in deforestation for the same period. These were the first monthly reports to come out since the pandemic of the new coronavirus reached alarming levels in the region.
The increase comes against the backdrop of institutional turmoil and budgetary cuts within Brazil’s environmental control body, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources. The weakening of Bolsonaro’s government institutions and their ability to enforce the law was documented by an INPE report produced in December 2019.
INPE’s DETER system — the Real Time Deforestation Detection System — monitors the entire Legal Amazonian rainforest and alerts authorities to illegal activity soon after it occurs，”Scott Wallace, (New York 07-19-19).
During the first four months of 2020, the federal government detected 1,202 square kilometers of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, the highest for this period in at least 5 years. The comparison was to the same period in 2019 when 1,593 square kilometers were monitored. rampant destruction of the world’s largest rainforest. Official monitoring of the rainforest surface is by satellites Meanwhile, the INPE’s early warning deforestation detection system lost a full month of satellite data from Amapá.
On Thursday, INPE released April’s numbers. They reveal that 407 square kilometers of deforestation was recorded in the Amazon last month, a 64% increase compared to the previous April. That means that in just one month, an area three times the size of Rio de Janeiro’s territory was deforested. Although it is an alarming number, it is still lower than the INPE’s predictions which forecast a rise of up to 700 square kilometers.
These were the first monthly deforestation reports to be released since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Environmentalists have been asking the INPE to provide monthly updates for more timely data. IBAMA, however, uses INPE satellite data as a cross-reference as it does its own monitoring on the ground. INPE originally released the April data on its website just this week, on Wednesday. A public outcry followed asking for more transparency prompting the agency to re-release the data on Thursday, this time including a methodology report.
The Real-time Deforestation Detection System – better known as DETER — was set up to inform law enforcement about new and ongoing deforestation in the Amazon. Since Jair Bolsonaro took office on January 1, 2019, the DETER database has been the target of a series of attacks by the federal and presidential governments. INPE is widely recognized as one of the top monitoring institutions in the world of forest cover because of DETER, of its annual PRODES figures on deforestation and its research on the impact of burning the rainforest for soybean and cattle operations.
In August 2019, President Jair Bolsonaro fired then-INPE director Ricard Galvão after the INPE released data showing deforestation rates in the Amazon were at their highest in over 10 years of monitoring. Galvão initially warned he would resign if the new government continued its public assaults on INPE.
In December 2019, the INPE published a series of reports demonstrating that environmental laws had been significantly weaker over the last 14 months. The INPE demonstrated that environmental crime enforcement efforts fell by 20% for the first 14 months of the new Presidential administration. In areas such as illegal deforestation, the number of cases opened fell by 15% for the same period while environmental fines for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon were cut in half in for 2019.
In both of INPE main deforestation monitoring programs the Amazon program coordinator, Lubia Vinhas, was removed from her position as coordinator of the DETER and Amazon programs last year. Demonstrators on the part of Indigenous groups also protested last Friday Raoni Metuktire liderando um protesto anti-Bolsonaro em Brasília neste mês.

“Bolsonaro wants to eliminate Indigenous people and open these lands to mining, mining and loggers and how is he doing this? By weakening deforestation surveillance because deforestation, once it starts, is the first step in “sterilizing” Indigenous lands,” said Brent Millikan, director of OneEarth.
Millikan says historical data demonstrates that immediately after the first migrants enter a forested conservation area, squatters, miners and land grabbers arrive soon after, penetrating and significantly expanding their networks over the course of a few years.

“INPE has been losing salaried [monitoring employees] who are deeply specialized.

The information is robust enough to resist any institutional defamation spreading out.” Natural Resources, arguing that convicted environmental felons be barred from holding public office.

Conflict over pet projects Like many countries, Brazil has long struggled to balance the need for transport and energy infrastructure with the need to preserve the environment. The current Congress passed laws during the first months of the Temer government that weakened a number of environmental protections. Temer and his supporters have struck back against international criticism of Brazil's policy towards the Amazon, insisting that his project that costs taxpayers $500 million a year is a global one. “It’s something that is larger that the ambition of countries ... to create, to save the environment,"" Temer told Bloomberg News Thursday in a joint interview with four other Latin American leaders, in which he credited Bolsonaro with telling him, ""Why do you take these critics into account?” Bolsonaro, for his part, issued a six-page declaration that condemns Temer’s May pre-election peace agreement with truckers who would have been hurt by the rising prices of fuel. “Truckers cannot be the State’s hostages,” he said last month, as he endorsed an amendment that would dictate the minimum freight price, regardless of the law of supply and demand.

Write a news article to discuss carbon emissions.,"trump deals another blow to vehicle emission controls.
Earlier this week, Trump administration workers at the Labor Department proposed a rule that would allow tip-pooling in restaurants. In an everyday sense, this means that your waiter might share some of the tips you leave with the restaurants’ bus boys or dishwashers. But really what it does is let restaurant owners to keep a chunk of money intended for service industry workers in the name of “redistributing wealth,” allowing them to pocket what transmission mechanism entrepreneur Cass Sunstein dubbed “dark nudges,” rather than actually relying on policy tools that would help lift restaurant workers from poverty. Now the administration has taken a similar approach to climate change, a policy where the carbon-reducing goals they were given weren’t being met.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggested to close out 2017 this week that poor, unable-to-afford-current-models drivers aren’t making good use of any money they save from purchasing an older, used car to, say, buy healthier food for themselves and their families. Why else, the argument goes, would they not just take advantage of their cheaper cars to drive more and increase their risk of death and that of their fellow Americans?
The answer is that they likely do spend some of those extra savings on driving more. But the NHTSA is effectively raising the question as a backdoor argument that higher vehicle standards do in fact save dollar rather than costing them, i.e., forcing people to buy more expensive, safer cars now rather than cheaper, less safe ones in the future. In response to a question about increasing safety measures of automobiles to the Obama administration’s 2020 vehicle emissions standard, NHTSA Administrator Heidi King said Thursday, “The science that we fund, of course, is leading to safer vehicles, right? It’s interesting to ask the question if safer vehicles will lead to longer driving.”
That makes an inappropriately known fact out of at least two contested questions. The first is that poorer drivers ’beaters tend to be less fuel efficient than new cars, meaning that they emit more than can be accounted for by simply driving more. It’s plausible they would drive even more and faster if they could afford newer cars, absent fuel economy regulations. But it’s also plausible that consumers will remain stingy even as car companies are disproportionately hurting over the wheels they’re trading them.
More broadly, it’s important to note that these changes wouldn’t just hurt the environment and your wallet under the guise of saving you dolla-dolla bills yo. According to Union of Concerned Scientists’ President Ken Kimmel, “Since the 2025 federal fuel economy and global warming emissions standards were finalized in 2012, a cascade of studies and data have unequivocally affirmed the environmental and economic benefits of strong standards…[and automakers] are not asking for this change because they can’t meet the standards. They are asking for it because the standards are saving consumers billions of dollars in fuel costs, and America’s drivers are not buying as much fuel as they used to. The industry is being disrupted by the rapid technological advances required to meet the standard, like increased electrification of cars, and autonomous vehicles. But rather than innovate they have chosen to wage a war against standards that help the environment and make consumers lives better.”",0.17989858550330004,left

To the Editor:
Re “Social Cost of Carbon Is Almost $200 Per Ton, Study Finds” (Climate, May 24):
Given that carbon pollution acts as a climate control knob with no off switch, and it’s mainly emitted by wealthy people in wealthy countries to the detriment of mostly poor people and in poor countries, a carbon tax is a ridiculously crude, inefficient and inequitable wedge to use for large-scale mitigation.
Carbon emissions exist as a function of economics — too many consumers of different energy sources that emit carbon — and of climate change-driven risks. Climate change regulation exists already in decades of environmental policy and in risk-based underwriting. Let these be the indirect, effective and equitable mechanisms for addressing the climate change agents.

To the Editor:
For the “social cost of carbon” to be effectively employed, it needs to be implemented globally. Its impact is diminished if a significant amount of the emissions “saved” results in lower compliance costs and higher profits in countries without the carbon pricing. Therefore to gain international support we need to distribute emissions-cost revenue among the global community. An international policy should provide, other than administrative costs, every human with an equal share of the revenue from emissions, regardless of the catch of the signatory nation.
For historical non-signatories lacking the mechanisms to distribute the revenue to all citizens, the United Nations could accept revenue to finance global humanitarian relief and development projects.",0.22790338036914667,left
Write a news article to explain carbon emissions.,"what is 'carbon,' the emissions currency, even if trump doesn't count it?.
The 23rd United Nations climate conference, known as the COP23, wrapped up last week in Bonn, Germany. There, governments worked out the rules for implementing the modest, 2015 Paris accords, but otherwise dropped the big idea of phasing out of coal for electricity. Environmental organizations (among them Greenpeace) described President Donald Trump as ""isolated"" in his promotion of ""unapologetic and explicit support for the fossil fuel industry."" Moreover, environmental organizations have also accused the German organization that ran the conference of pandering to one of that country's most powerful industries: coal.
If ""climate change"" is the broad problem that just doesn't resonate enough on the ground, how do interested parties make it into a potent political issue?
Coal spews the highest levels of carbon into the atmosphere. An efficient kilowatt hour of electricity derived from burning coal will generate 2,200 pounds of carbon dioxide while natural gas weighs in at no more than 541 pounds. However, the tale from the second half of the last century of coal as a easier, cheaper source of fuel has domestic, and well as international, political, and social implications. Despite the previous administration's rather successful emissions regulations, there remains a great deal of sanctioned coal mining in the United States. The President made one of his big campaign promises that, in a revival of the industry, the miners (down from 892,000 in 1923 to 53,000 in 2016, at the end of his campaign) would be going back to work. Meanwhile, the fact remains that the real work horses of the coal industry can't be found.

So, if indeed ""climate change"" is the broad problem that just doesn't resonate enough on the ground, how do interested parties make it into a potent political issue?
Before 1947, the common grace of the atmosphere was viewed in the common law as something to which everyone had equal access and could use without fear of interference. But in the smog-choked American city, the air and the rain that fell from it were seen as causing injury to property. The Pittsburg-based Flowers Co. produced zinc and sulfuric acid, emitting gas and dust that ""would cover the territory in a radius of 200 miles to the greater part with an invisible smudge or pall, thus preventing the free access of light through the atmosphere to a substantial extent."" A New Jersey resident who sought to raise roses was awarded a $5,000 jury verdict, one which was eventually upheld by Supreme Court. The upshot is that he who suffers injury through a ""broad and comprehensive social interdependence"" has a claim for redress. And this is no small implication of the Supreme Court's decision.

Back in 2017, then-Candidate Trump campaigned even harder on bringing back jobs than on eliminating environmental regulation. As it happened, unemployment in the mining sector was no small part of the cooling for enthusiastic labor endorsement of the Obama-Clinton climate change agenda. Despite everything else, in this climate that was recognized carbon emissions could still be traded for success with influential flyover companies. The President of the United States that doesn't let coal count as it used to will never be seen speaking at the U.N. again.
In what is being described as a big step, French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that, even as the American president has abandoned the campaign promise to drop out of the hastily prepared Biden-Kerry power plan, he has more or less invited the start-ups from COP23 to use France as their headquarters for the emerging ""One Planet."" As the Sustainable Development Scenario so emphasizing reliance on common sense and individual claims, why wouldn't they be willing to foot the bill? Administering the ""One Planet,"" 1% of the world's ecosystem is expected to wind up purchasing a defunct coal mine or power plant or a living wage for a failed miner or other climate reparation. But all of this pressure to get the rest of the world focuses on common sense, while our insider Stanford economist, Dick Haitser points out that, ""Obama's ambition to all but eliminate carbon quickly,"" is a victim and a signal for us the two trillion dollars that VIP sensitivities have put on the table. Will it be enough? As Professor Haiter proffers, ""The holdout fossil fuel industry doesn't like being demonized and overwhelming the rest.

Quoting Rabindranath Tagore, Emmanuel Macron confessed at a press conference on Sunday that he and Narendra Modi spoke ‘with one voice’ to urge greater use of the sun’s energy. But there is no common voice on this issue.
Adnan Amin, director-general of the United Arab Emirate’s International Renewal Energy Agency (Irena) told a major India-EU meeting in New Delhi last week that carbon emissions were once again on the rise due to the addition of nearly1,200 gigawatts of new coal-based capacity that is under development, mostly in Asian countries with high growth but low electricity consumption.
Amin warned that these plants once up and running will emit almost as much as the European Union in 2015 and set off an upward trend in the world’s carbon annual emissions. He added, however, that, “Solar and wind power tariffs have tumbled in India whereas declining costs have also prompted financial institutions and businesses to cancel proposed new coal plants”
Irena’s mission is to support countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future,, and Amin said it is the only intergovernmental organizations which has made this possible.

Sens. Cantwell And Murkowski Lead Legislators In Fight To Recognize And Combat Ocean Acidification
Ocean acidification messes with the brains of fish as well as ocean life in the shell.
On Thursday, Maria Cantwell, D.-Wash., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, introduced a bill to take the fight on near and far, both in time and location. The Ocean Acidification Innovation Act works to combat the effects of ocean acidification on marine species and help coastal communities adapt to changes in ocean environments.
It calls for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to lead federal research on ocean acidification, and gives NOAA the go-ahead to give cash prizes to people, organizations and companies working to fight ocean acidification. Those prizes designated by NOAA would have to be no less than $5,000 or more than $250,000, and anyone interested in going for one of these prizes must register with NOAA.",0.41386326495558023,center
Write a news article to debate ocean acidification.,"don’t trust epa to decide the health of our waters and national oceanic and atmospheric administration funding is critical to understanding and addressing ocean acidification..
In recent months, the oceans have begun to shoulder the environmental burden that we as a society have placed on them. Fish stocks are feeling the heat as a result of unchecked climate change: Waters are warming, habitats are changing, and already sensitive species have a tough time keeping up. More frequent and intense hypoxia, or depleted oxygen levels, in the ocean, which was once considered an issue confined only to far-off regions such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Chesapeake Bay, is now a disturbingly local issue. And, due to nutrient pollution, we have created more than 400 recorded “Dead Zones” around the world -- bodies of water where the oxygen loss is so great nothing can live.
We must be concerned about what happens next. Ocean acidification, the often overlooked and often under-appreciated counterpart to global warming, arises when the oceans absorb the 25 million tons (yes, that’s 25 million) of excess CO2 that we humans emit into the atmosphere every day. Simple chemistry tells us that when CO2 and H2O mix, the ocean becomes more acidic. The reduction in the water’s pH is causing profound changes in ocean chemistry, making it more difficult for marine organisms to build their shells and skeletons. Already, economically important species, such as oysters and clams, are struggling to grow and reproduce. If left unchecked, more than just seafood lovers could suffer: The entire marine food web could feel the effects as corals, pteropods, and calcifying plankton disappear.
Until recently, some skeptics in the United States questioned if ocean acidification was even a real problem. But just like the curtain has been pulled back on the damage that climate change is causing on the land, the same is starting to happen under the waves. Already, scientists can point to specific examples of how ocean acidification is altering the chemistry of the ocean and threatening marine life. Those in the Pacific Northwest, which is ground zero for U.S. ocean acidification, are learning how changes in the chemistry of the region’s coastal waters are affecting the sea floor and oyster farms that workers depend on for income. Ocean acidification isn’t just something that’s happening off the coast of Oregon, Maine, and Maryland, its effects are measurable closer to home, with both New England states and Maryland now monitoring their coastal ocean to better understand how ocean acidification is changing the marine environment.
The threat of ocean acidification is real, but so is the opportunity to act to address the cause and consequences. In recent months, elected officials in the House and Senate have been engaged in making decisions that will help stem the worst effects of ocean acidification. Senators Susan Collins (ME), Sheldon Whitehouse (RI), Maria Cantwell (WA), and Mark Warner (VA) have all shown interest in supporting efforts to better monitor and quantify the impacts of acidification across the country. However, these efforts are a mixed bag when it comes to ensuring that enough science is done to fully understand how acidification is affecting marine life, and what can be done to protect coastal states from its worst effects. State monitoring programs and other approaches to assessing the threat of ocean acidification can provide some of the data needed to answer these questions, but it is not enough to meet the scope and scale of the ocean acidification challenge.
Federal funding for state research and monitoring programs -- like the Ocean Acidification Program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -- is critical to understanding and addressing ocean acidification. We cannot leave it up to kind-hearted people to decide whether or not to fund the science that’s needed to solve this coastal threat. Additionally, we can’t ignore that the primary driver of ocean acidification is carbon pollution. Rather than continue the politically charged debate about the reality of acidification, more purposeful effort must be given to cutting carbon pollution and investing in this solvable problem. This summer, government researchers deserve to know their jobs -- and the crucial work they do -- are safe and secure.",0.2964015615483125,left

To the editor: My response to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) plans to “jam the Democrats” on climate change by voting on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-N.Y.) New Green Deal proposal, among others, is this: It is inexcusable for McConnell to have buried this issue while seizing the mantle of pragmatic leadership. No such label can remain credible while ignoring the latest federal government report on climate change and evidence of its impact in states like his own. (“Democrats employ options to challenge GOP stances on climate change,” Dec. 10)
This is a time when so many states are dealing individually with issues like ocean acidification, substantially impacting jobs and recreational ocean harvest. California’s lobster fishery, for example, is taking a severe hit because climate change is wreaking havoc on the organism’s life stages and therefore on the industry’s catch.
Rather than wrongly contrasting political realities with the urgency of climate change, Democrats are challenging Republicans to use or risk their power to engage meaningfully on this issue. My heart is with them.

The water's murky in the San Juan Channel, but Max Bakal's 32-foot research boat contains all the technologies the 27-year-old scientist needs to navigate the waters and improve British Columbia's $30 million herring fishery.
Of these technologies, Bakal — a second-generation ocean farmer — is most proud of the four baby seaweed plants in his boat's cabin. An expert in kelp cultivation, Bakal, who works for Seattle-based Marine Agronomics, is part of a team testing the viability of commercial seaweed farming in B.C.
The recent sea blob scare off Vancouver Island also shows how dense seaweed can now intercept farmed salmon infestations.
But the taurine-rich algae is also being closely watched by West Coast ocean researchers because it removes carbon dioxide from seawater and produces oxygen as it grows. As marine ecologist Maya Watts, an expert in kelp studies at Western Washington University, puts it: ""Seaweed acts like a kind of a vacuum drawing C02 out of the seawater. It represents one of the only natural solutions to climate change.""
While kelp isn't the only seaweed in the oceans, Bakal is working with Mazza Innovation to create an organic, natural and sustainable solution to heart disease: hope.
According to Health Canada, heart disease is the second-leading cause of death in the country, with the most common symptom being angina pectoris — acute chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart, areas of the U.S., live on high-fat diets, which results in arterial plaque buildup.
Since major surgery is still the only way to completely clear plaque, most families leave the operation room minus one vital organ. But according to a 2018 scientific paper from the University of Guelph, an exception is the Irish: less than half of them with arterial plaque are actually suffering from heart disease.
""We looked at dietary patterns and it turns out that the Irish consume three to four times more seaweed than [residents from other Atlantic islands],"" explained the study's lead author, Guelph biomedical engineering professor David Ma.

People’s greed for status could doom the planet
As senior representatives from more than 30 of America’s largest corporations, we met in Washington DC on Monday to tell lawmakers our environment isn’t someone else’s problem. It’s everyone’s problem.
These businesses, most of which are household names, can already see the problems that will arise if extreme action is not taken now. While environmental concerns are not new, changes in laws have been slow to come by. This meeting served as a message to lawmakers: we no longer have the luxury of time. We need all of us on board. And we need to move as quickly as possible.
It’s truly unprecedented, and the clearest signal to date that corporate America is more than up to the task of combating our climate crisis.Jenuwine

As leaders at these companies have explored ways of minimizing their carbon footprints and ensuring that their supply chains include workers who are fairly compensated and treated with dignity, they’ve understood the urgent need to advocate for laws and rules that protect the world.
It’s in America’s economic interest to create the right policies and to guard against environmental crises. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the US Congress has already appropriated $1.6bn to respond to last year’s hurricanes, $4.5bn to help farmers recover from 2017’s disastrous wildfires and at least $1.3bn in individual assistance following storm related emergencies. This financial burden would be lessened if these policy changes are made.
We were eager to let members of Congress, from both sides of the aisle, know about the actions we and others are taking, and how they could support our initiatives.
The “US Consumer Market for Plant-Based Foods” report, released in March, showed that US retail sales of plant-based foods had by now, already topped $3.3bn. Products such as plant-based meats are contributing to a market that is growing twice as fast as the broader food sector.

The former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy described how the global population continued to rise and noted that the rapidly developing world’s appetite for rich diets would make our planet an even less sustainable place. She said our challenges cry out for courageous and transformational leadership and that we are now experiencing “perilously slow” action when urgency is what true leaders offer.
Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island, opened the discussion positively by saying: “The environment ranks right up there as one of the most important things Congress can get right for a whole bunch of reasons that you (business leaders) went through.” Republican representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who co-chairs the Climate Solution Caucus, indicated that this forum was an opportunity to share best practices on how we can “address the negative environmental impacts”.
Many people see business leaders and Congress as operating in separate realms and assume the relationship is adversarial. It can be. But we are all allies in fighting for laws and rules that protect the world from rapid environmental change.

Afterwards, depending on the weather, I would leave for home right away or stay overnight if a storm was starting up.” (It was like living large.) began a full Academy education, and she “learned about medieval law and all that.” But university was interrupted by the German invasion of Lublin on 18 September 1939.

Write a news article to explain renewable energy.,"so you’re a climate-change skeptic? well, you should still use renewable energy.
Like wind and solar power, a well-placed rain barrel has energy-saving potential, but it’s not without serious environmental impact. Rainbow-color barrels may hold the dribble of rainfall that otherwise would have run off your roof and down the drain to a nearby waterway. But — and it’s a big “but” — these pretty containers are already supplying many urban gardeners, orchard growers and small-scale farmers with essential water that is captured, stored and delivered in better ways.

Our water-worn urban landscape includes curbs, streets, alleys and roofs that shuttle each raindrop that falls in the District directly to the Chesapeake Bay. Most of this water is, to borrow W.C. Fields’s description, recycled in large amounts by structural barriers spaced over to prevent single-point pollution.
In a severe storm, stormwater rushes after a recent rainfall in the Tiber Hudson storm water retention system in Ellicott City, Md. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)
A lowly 55-gallon container isn’t a significant solution to urban storm-water management, of course. But large volumes of water stored in multibarrel systems or cisterns can deliver those twice-a-week drinks that are essential to the newest blooms on your clematis vine. More important, that locally collected water reduces public demand and steady supply that has a price set not by the water’s volume, but by infrastructure restoration and replacement.
Bruce Bacon’s experiences are a beguiling, Watery Double-Fudge for would-be rain-harvesters. On the one hand, the current president of the D.C. Road Runners is recognized in the national capital for running large, effective water-stewardship programs. His organization installed two 52-plant, rain-collecting gardens and a 5,000-gallon cistern at Bluemont Park in Arlington. His home garden in Arlington Ridge in Arlington, in conjunction with the nation’s leading nonprofit environmental network, supports programs for the elucidation of multiple levels of storm-water best-management practices. His successes come with many adventures, all works in progress, all almost-was-nots.
Relaxing on Bruce Bacon's back deck, a near neighbor in Arlington Ridge, Va., looks back towards Washington in 2010. (Jad Davenport)
Typically, we have another “water moment” in which my commentary reads like something I deserve for presuming to stray from the garden page. Bacon, as is very much his style, bolsters our conversation with questions for my familiar theme of What If asking: What if members of our tribe could successfully engage in community advocacy and a campaign in Richmond with the governor’s office about the often costly DCRA [District of Columbia Regulatory Administration] unregistering of rain barrels? What if other water-crisis connectors with local conservation leaders in purist Baltimore and the eco indulgent suburbs of Bethesda, Md., could get on the same, sweet page?
If such provincial purity were ever to work, it could only be done by the Bacon model, you might be thinking — an idea that takes root in the spread of what gardeners the world over would find. What’s Virginia-forstell in the high and rainy cutover peaks of Queensland may ratchet down much more appropriately along eastern Australia’s eastern seaboard, but the riparian fringe represented by the Daintree Lowlands provides adequate platforms for coastal-water refugiunality of at least the crested-Saltola, the orange-footed-utanic and the quickly depleting Great Barrier disparitae penguin.
By spring, it all boils down to two conditions that cannot co-inflate for the species to regain any bit of its ephemeral existence. Linear-constuction containment of water-forlayesian-and out-and-backin-and regulation is a necessary how-do-you-do, but by folks drilling and blasting chondrials in the ground may be one step toward downsided dramaturgy of danlandsians.
Also the Riverlanders would not know whether to they suppose to be the faces of the world the influence of our champions that the place is occupied to their sidelong gibes, and on the other hand they babbled like naughty lords and overthrew their economies to the trade, and the side of his heart of the continent his flamboyant tastes were fed.

All sorts of neighbors call convene their various organizations so all of us, the inhabitants of the community, can arrange to discuss how they could help the DCRA not to abandon its promise to register rain barrels, conversation permitting.
What if environmental organizations played along with those that had yet to be inspiring and precise meanings of both conjouring and understanding the actual ideology of the “E” and the “CO” in VCME?",0.5369404703378677,center

Write a news article to pose a question regarding renewable energy.,"biden gets unions in climate plan but trump the challenge.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has crafted a plan to support renewable energy jobs by protecting workers’ rights to unionize and raise wages while bolstering the country’s trillion-dollar rail system to shift both energy and essential workers to, and within, gridlocked metropolises like major European cities have done for years.
But Biden’s climate change proposal falls short of crystallizing how the process would play out between local and state officials, and where they would place energy infrastructure. That topic is now being framed by President Trump and his administration in the recent revival of their criticism for liberal proposals to remove certain American dams to help fish migrate or control flooding.
“We can put steelworkers to work installing idle wind turbines, transmission and transportation systems made in the U.S., as we shift from natural gas and other ‘small molecule’ exports to exporting large amounts of wind produced in rural America,” wrote Biden supporters in the Democratic National Committee (DNC) environmental group, the Council on the Environment and Climate Crisis, in a letter this week. “The mobile large-scale manufacturing jobs will support the path to unionized permanent clean energy jobs.”
But within Trump country, a region that elected him president multiple times four years ago, the DNC was criticized for keeping the platform vague on dam removal. Matt Harrington, president of the Republic Union-Snyder of Union Township, told E&E News that there are dam owners who are recognized as stakeholders in the relicensing process and would include concerns from environmentalists, endangered fish and flood control.
“The first thing that comes to mind with these proposals” to remove dams, he said, “is federal overreach.”",0.1767473059395949,left
Write a news article to discuss wildlife conservation.,"i am pro-life, so this world wildlife day let's mobilize to protect creation.
On the 6th of March World Wildlife Day is celebrated, followed by the World Day of Prayer which takes place on the first Friday of March and encourages people to pray for a common cause and take actions together. This Prayer Day is also an important type of commemorating the idea of Creation itself.
From Scripture, we know that God endowed man with a special dignity, and that He calls upon him to enter into a personal relationship with Him. We also know that in the book of Genesis, He entrusted man with the stewardship of all creation. Human life is therefore sacred and the dignity of the human person is the starting point in our care for family and neighbor.
What I have come to realize is that my pro-life views continue with problems of environmental stewardship and nature preservation. God’s designs are good. We are to safeguard our neighbors by protecting the very creation of the world we live in. Even when Scripture says that ""everything that [God] had made … was very good"" (Gen 1:31), before giving man the command to fill the earth and subdue it (cf. Gen 1:28), it was necessary for man to accept his nature and a limitation that came with it. Now that we are “subduing” the earth, we overcome selfishness so that we can attain what is needed by future generations. We need to be subdue to God, His divine Will and His interests and therefore protect the world so that it may continue be fruitful and be a place for humans to live in freedom as the Lord has intended them to provide.",0.514132596552372,right
Write a news article to debate wildlife conservation.,"3 articles that reflect the current state of the cultivate-it-and-it-will-come nature of climate change:
To shoot wildlife in the forests of India is no less a violation. One can understand one or two individuals trying to make a quick buck. After all, we hail from a society where officials siphon off flood relief. The bigger shame is when corporations and policy-makers disregard wildlife laws, forest rights, and the laws of biology to blatantly annihilate our natural heritage. The sanitiser culture has forced us to disconnect from nature. It feels easy to forget that nature is watching and taking notes. India has a wildlife policy that is impractical. Most species cannot survive in 2 to 3 sq km. Their resilience will wear off. With monoculture plantations and increased “developmental” activities, India’s wildlife policy is basically a death sentence . We need our forests to lock the carbon. We need clean air. So, in the same breath when we talk about renewables, it is ironic that we are failing in meeting Paris Protocol obligations of cutting down on carbon fuel consumption. Even if we meet our targets, selective industrial clearances, manic road and power grid extensions will only lead to civilisational collapse. As it is we are seeing sweltering summers usher unprecedented water crisis in many of our cities, famines in rural India with bean counters too focused on bullet training us back to 1960s England – leaving hundreds to die of starvation in India’s second most agrarian state, Madhya Pradesh. The laws of the jungle were never imposed on nature. On the contrary, they were the devotional truths that nature lived by. Guys with size, money, genes, technology of big machines don’t need them to take on the little guy. We are nothing but fleas on nature’s back to be defended against malaria and foolishness. If we destroy wildlife and forests, we don’t destroy just homes of elephants but our own echo chambers. Vegan elephants actually play a greater role than we do in reducing our carbon foot print. More emissions than Bengal tigers? Let us not pit one against the other. It is important that instead of speakers reading their party diktat, we need policy to work in harmony.

Write a news article to highlight wildlife conservation.,"in china, the key to gaining cooperation on climate change may be energy policy — and more.
Li replied the actions were very important, especially from the business sector.
“ The Chinese business sector can really benefit from two aspects of the solution to climate change,” he said. Industry can increase efficiency by reducing waste. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called upon industry to reduce energy waste and environmental pollution. “If you fulfill the requirement, you can have a bigger share of market,” Li said.
The Chinese government is pressing companies, households and industry to reduce pollution and waste. If retirement communities do not properly sort and remove food waste, which emits methane and carbon dioxide, they could face penalties or high collection fees, reports a China Daily article about Trashye Village. Residents of urban neighborhoods in Shanghai will be required to do the same by 2020.
The effort increases responsibility for and accountability by waste producers and radically changes societal views of waste. Producing waste is airm meat and the problem gets harder when there is not enough space to throw it. Even if more affluent Chinese consumers would prefer not to eat a pangolin, more group members will be encouraged to do so if there is ever-decreasing environmental space for the sizable colony to exist. In the energy sector, forward-thinking Chinese industrialists who reduce emissions and increase reliance on renewable energy sources such as hydropower will be poised to be leaders as China pushes industrial growth and efficiency.
In late 2016, Beijing officials requested military assistance to remove tent camps piled high with trash left by 60,000 migrant workers on the north edge of Beijing. Trash collectors were also dispatched to the site. Officials understood that protecting the environment and holding businesses responsible requires cooperation among business, the government and its peoples.",0.5938547129432361,right
Write a news article to explain wildlife conservation.,"proposed changes to wildlife law would hinder conservation efforts.
Interim Executive Director for the Wilderness Society Regarding “Interim Executive Director for the Wilderness Society on proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act ” (‘‘Congress moves to weaken U.S. endangered species act,’’ July 3, LATimes.com):
As stewards of more than 110 million acres of federally-designated wilderness, The Wilderness Society is inextricably linked to the health of our nation's wildlife, including threatened and endangered species like the grizzly bear, Canada lynx, and black-footed ferret. However, even wildlife that isn't listed as threatened or endangered yet is central to the well-being of these wild places, occupying critical links in the food chain and playing an essential role in the overall balance of the ecosystem. If these proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act pass, the well-being of our wildlife and public lands will suffer. Weakening the Act, even in the subtlest ways, sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to catastrophic consequences for future conservation, and could unravel years of progress and the time-honored ability of communities, land managers, and conservationists to unite behind common principles protecting this nation's imperiled wildlife. I strongly urge congressional leadership to halt efforts to undo this Act and allow wildlife and their habitats to thrive as intended by the law’s framers.
With so many challenges facing the natural world, now is the time to unite and redouble our efforts to ensure a chorused upholding of this bedrock environmental law.",0.2877722332874934,left

Hollie Burns, seven, with Rieke, a three-month-old baby Sumatran Orang-utan, at Monkey World ape rescue centre in Wareham, Dorset PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Controlled media may not carry stock pictures, live video or audio of children such as Hollie who have been terminally ill. They also may not publish her surname.
A seven-year-old girl with a brain tumour has spent the day ""living the dream"" of meeting baby and two-year-old orang-utans.
Hollie Burns made the emotional visit to Monkey World, near Wool in Dorset, as she is obsessed with the endangered animals and has always dreamed of seeing them up close.
The Hampshire schoolgirl, who is receiving palliative care, loved the wildlife park trip and its Monkey Business family, including babies Rieke and Bulu Mata and their mothers.
""She's just been fantastic. She's really reacted to the orang-utans, they've come right up to her and checked her out,"" her mother Shirley said.
""Having the opportunity to get involved so closely, she's just been giggling and laughing.
""She's living the dream. They're her absolute favourites.""
In January Hollie was diagnosed with a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma following an MRI scan, a type of cancer affecting around 30 children a year, with most dying inside nine months.
The family are currently bidding for treatment in Germany, where the Hyeron cervical vaccine has shrunk the tumour in an eight-year-old girl on its second round of therapy.
""We know it may not work, but we're not prepared to sit around not trying,"" Mrs Burns said.
""It may not be forever, but it's right now we want and Maddie (Hollie's five-year-old sister) has swallowed the book on German schools tonight.""
Mrs Burns added, of their afternoon at Monkey World: ""Just seeing her in the background and living it, she loves wildlife September than anything.

To the editor: Big bang for the buck. A no-brainer. Set to expire. A honeypot for the poor. (-AC-squared: ) Bring home the bacon, stand the test of time, kill the deadwood and fix the worst after the fact.
You get the idea. It seems that legislators can’t help themselves: They see or hear a cliché involving living things, and look out! It’s got to go: It’s on the endangered list if at best. This would be funny (way), but for the fact that they often replace living things phrases with DOA language or sometimes, in a leap of illogic, with meaningless doublespeak acronyms.
Exhibit A for this behavior: shaping budget policy in squirrelly ways. The list just continues growing.

To the editor: Language is our code of societal conduct, a ladder to the broken hearted, a helpmate to the tired poet and a klieglight for ideas. Educators and entertainers keep our vocabulary growling with neologisms, an interesting juxtaposition and a homophonic to keep up in the digital age.
Macho and radical, hyperbolic language is a shy knock harder to to get in the door. English must be the hothouse plant: It requires tender care but rewards tenfold.
Shakespeare, the poor boy made good, and Dickens bring nuggets to the barren desert. Then there’s Berryman clearing out the fog with clarity. All that being said, language is a piece of cake and copasetic.

Write a news article to debate sustainable farming.,"tackling climate change by restoring the american farm tradition.
Ms. McDaniel’s grandparents left Appalachia during the Great Depression, like so many others, to find opportunity in the industrialized northern cities. But they kept their love of the land and the sense that something honorable and decent was derived from being farmers. So in 1975, they moved to New Milford, Conn., to begin farming. “We owe a debt,” Ms. McDaniel said, “to all the black families whose means of wealth was stolen from them. We may never be able to repay it in full, but we can adhere to the principles of organic farming. In this country, principles like those are the means by which wealth is actually created.”
We are now at a place of great danger with climate change. Like any problem, or crisis, the first step lies in facing the reality of it. Today an unusual bipartisan coalition of military, national intelligence, science, business and religious leaders issued their own consensus statement: “It’s less safe world with more and more abundant & cheaper renewable energy.” It is now time to spread the news and understanding of the scope of the danger.
But absent leadership at the top, which seems to me unlikely at the moment, there is much the rest of us can do. Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe was once asked on 60 minutes, “Well if it is so hopeless why should we in the North Texas region or anywhere else do anything?” Her reply was sharp and eloquent, “Because amazing things happen when people start to think differently”. For starters, those of us who can, get rid of our gas guzzlers and switch to an electric car, advocate for rules encouraging a carbon tax rather than its repeal and practice our own version of Fully Restored.",0.27727825939655304,left
Write a news article to highlight sustainable farming.,"clearing the air for sustainable farming.
To the Editor:
“ Meat Is Linked to Higher Cancer Risk, Two Big Studies Find ” (front page, May 7) and “ Last Thing Climate Talks Need: More Carbon Offsets ” (news article, April 29) were bookends in a month when the obvious became inescapable: that stopping climate change, combating air pollution and preventing tragedies like what is happening to Lake Erie all come back to what we eat and how it is grown.
As the world warms and food production is threatened, and as the health costs of factory farming mount up, the answer to reducing emissions is right under our noses: farming that builds rather than destroys the air, soil and water that give us life. More than 70 percent of the land in farming in America, and crop land worldwide, is in industrial monocultures that produce about half of farming’s greenhouse gas pollution. Most of that pollution can be wiped out with regenerative farming practices that are based on our 10,000-year agricultural tradition and that are ready to go. More than growing our food, farms are our protectors.",0.17546393504987162,left

“It’s not that fair,” an Indian woman in a neon pink silk sari tells me one morning, in the midst of the chaos of the New Delhi metro. We are barreling south to Astha Kunj, the holy river exhibition and fair my debating coworkers and I would be immersing ourselves in for the day. “The Chandra River [also known as the Chandrabhaga River] is much smaller than the Yamuna, but still gets attention,” she grumbles as I tune her out in an attempt to seem unimposing. The crowded car has decided I don’t need to hold onto the top bar, so it I squeeze my shoulders tightly to my ears and cradle my hands in-front of my chest—straddled in what is essentially a defensive shiver—looking as non-threatening as a brown Beatrix Potter animal.
I smile politely while thinking, “Aren’t you just the smallest bit curious why the Chandra gets such recognition?” I hold back asking in the fear of sending off Fox News alarm bells as to my callous liberalism and the woman in neon coming back with, “Why should we be doing anything?” and “Clean energy? The economy!” before I’ve swallowed my masala tea. Only a paltry ten minutes pass; my internal consonance blooms from annoyance to self-righteousness, however, it’s with our next stop that things take a swift shift from defiant and indignant bantering to sheer surprise.
We are slowly making our way through the Chandra’s earliest stallholders who are simultaneously bustling with the glory of preparation and the unavoidable hiccups of pre-dawn panic. Our group of debaters consist of Molly, an anthropology student with an impressive history of bone broths (a crass but accurate way of saying hundreds of hours spent scraping flesh off skulls), Emma, an impassioned Canadian, and Iman, the biggest feminist I have ever met in my entire life, pulling from a background in women’s studies and human rights law. And Denver, who in our inevitable headcount, mentions he did actually study at Western for a year before dropping out to tag salmon in Alaska and climb a mountain in California. I’m along for the ride, really, besides the encased-in-cellophane love for and maybe the not-so-occasional explosive anger toward feminism, the environment and human rights aren’t my causes. I prefer food. Hence, my excitement at and script-written altruism for the seed bank.
Yep, a day-and-a-half earlier, poor Molly found herself an unwilling participant in my overly enthusiastic yet feigned-agreement to spend 22 of our 24 exhibit hours working the free chai stall and helping sort through the maze of jars and wrapped pouches that make up Central Himalaya Farmer’s Producer Company Limited’s seed bank location. Maybe it was the neon woman, but as we drag ourselves through the river-bed under painting of women in various states of river-based piety, and disturbances in a display of broadranging austerities in metallic effigy. Holy men in red, orange and brown walk by us in the opposite direction, their grab concealed by robes adorned with religious informality. Rushing toward the door, our octogenarian guide turns briefly to let us know that we’re about to enter a mock holy site, surrounded taxidermied house-cats and Catalonian novellas of the Tibetan King Vindra and Kalahari Bushmen.
Simple in outwardness, our corridor opens up to display upon prior irony and blaring hypocrisy.
Somehow, this concept I’d personally very easily categorize from my Georgia parent’s as “farmer communism,” of farmers as the proletariat edited, here sit two explosive holograph booths of its opposite. I had successfully convinced myself—had successfully argued to those sounding off in early morning Facebook messages from campus “ack,” and “tar,” that the seed bank—really the festival in general—humbled the Earth’s longstanding femininity, tradition, and heirword history, lighthearted embraces of a myriad other ideology still see as self-righteously wavy. I still had a full 15 minutes before I needed to say anything to anyone and thus a few minutes before I cames plain.
The day-baring sun, weak too through white-sealed shacks and acting more so as a jack-o’-lantern form of borrowed light than as a distant orb aiming a surplus of rays our way, mentally courses out and reconciles my own prior agitations. Marveling at the countless and unending alternation of Buddhist and Hinu-Tantric shift, symbols that I could pass-out as juxtapositional text between my own intertwined, peace-loving, save-the-rainforest drives. True, Buddhism would likely liberate me from the necessary sense of consumerism seemingly endemic to modern day—and daytime and wealth-brimming—India. Still, if I can sit in on a hindu tradition from the very culture that allows my understanding for a vegan, fully herbivorous, completely non-meat and activism-abide life, if at any point my voguish volition I can turn inward and extol what should simply come forth between man and cow and hyena in the soirees that ensued, thus circumventing the necessity of a divine omphalic chase and the static needs of actual days and physical desires—the truth of tradition and reverence—than if I have the drive and the a-with-the-land attunement to understand if not the conducive divine right of agricultural focus.
After all, in the eonslong ago age, when first my kind rutted its way out of the familial welfare state, pummeling its way forth into unknown ecologies designated by geographical parameters ascertainable to animal and cunning only to man; when first I—or more correctly, relation—claimed that garden-nouveau, where else or on what rarer ground would any future citizen stand rather than the Indian subcontinent?

Write a news article to describe sustainable farming.,"these cows and robots are powering one of the world’s great race cars.
“We were looking for a way to go carbon neutral with our cows.” That’s not exactly the kind of statement you expect to hear from the technical director of Toyota’s World Endurance Championship team. At first glance, the “Earth Car” livery the team’s running at the 24 Hours of Le Mans this weekend would seem to be the most environmentally-friendly thing about them. “How do we make carbon neutral milk?” Mike says. “We take the manure they produce, get an NGO involved who can process them and unlock the methane. Then it’s multiple gas engines and generators which capture heat, carbon dioxide and electrical energy, and that goes to a grid which is supplying 70% of Toyota’s power at the factory.”
A combination of anaerobic digestion and some very clever sustainable farming practices have seen Toyota do some seriously cool stuff. As well as providing electricity to their local grid, the excess CO2 and heat produced by the gas burn-off is used to grow algae and lots of lovely plants in a greenhouse, which they can either sell on or use as part of the feed for the cows. All in all, this means that while the dairy operation produces a carbon footprint of 90g of CO2;l per litre of milk, Toyota since 2016, the operation has been entirely carbon neutral.
The first mobility adaptation was to take a lot of this tech to replicate in part, the same process Mike’s teams used for waste heat scavenging in the WEC car – a tiny gas engine that runs on natural gas which captures both heat and electricity to help power the farm. Ever the engineers, the dairy team would insist on know everything about it – from the heat the engine produced to how much CO2 it produced – and the information exchanged has seen Toyota take a fresh look at how long their computers are on at Le Mans, and even cycle usage. All in all, this has seen – if you’ll excuse he bad pun – some truly hard and fast development work.
“Most people probably don’t see the point – it’s not getting our cars running any faster.” Mike says. “But it genuinely does; we’ve broadened the scope of who we work with, the dairy’s learned what we do in terms of waste heat scavenging but in return we’ve learned a hell of a lot from what they do, and I don’t think our understanding of our systems would be as wide as it is right now if we hadn’t taken on their help.”",0.4878568518906832,center
Write a news article to share a fact about sustainable farming.,"trump wanted to gut usda science. one republican talked him out of it..
According to POLITICO, the White House instructed the Department of Agriculture to write a plan to overhaul in its research branch mere weeks before the 2018 budget went to press. Beef research was noted as a priority, because Kansas Senator Jerry Moran ― who has consistently voted to reduce Agriculture Department spending in recent years ― “made a compelling case.”
At the behest of agriculture secretary and climate change denier Sonny Perdue, the White House ordered a complete reorganization of the Agriculture Research Service, which has remained “largely untouched by past efforts to over haul the bureaucracy.” Indeed, Trump’s advisers had initially proposed “deliberately stalling” the appointment of two of the agency’s top positions, which would then expire. But with Moran pushing back on the administration’s approach,¸Perdue and his allies, as well as top White House budget officials, have since “worked closely to keep the senator informed about changes” to the updated plan.",0.1777163191388051,left
Write a news article to pose a question regarding sustainable farming.,"a bill to help farmers with climate change should be uncontroversial. but it’s washington..
For a hint of the Pulitzer-Prize-winning journalism yet to come from the staff of the Charleston, West Virginia, Gazette-Mail, head over to the ProPublica website to read news that Republicans in the West Virginia state Senate have stripped a $4.7 million tax credit from a comprehensive, bipartisan bill requiring regulation of aboveground storage tanks. The tanks became critical state news last year when a chemical container leaked into the Elk River, poisoning the water that about 300,000 people use as drinking water. Perhaps the worst January spill of that kind since the Charleston disaster happened at a coal plant near Kingston, Tenn., but it was among the 428 such spills that happened in 22 counties throughout West Virginia between Jan. 9 and Feb. 5 that pushed the Gazette-Mail, which is already West Virginia’s Newspaper of Record, to launch an in-depth reporting venture.
Returning to the attack on the tanks bill, now as ProPublica Watchdog reporter Cora Currier writes: “The tax credit had been meant to offset the financial burden of inspections on rural public service districts, which provide water and sewer service and are typically funded through local taxes. In an amendment introduced yesterday, the provision was altered to instead give the same total amount in grants to the nine biggest public service districts in the state. (insertion of a simple number or letter. or typographic symbol.) ” That way, it becomes a cut for the two PSAs in Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin’s home area.” In the meantime, the new nonprofit reporting group Public Herald reconstructed the events that led to the failure of attempts by state lawmakers in Harrisburg, Pa., to give the shaft to some anti-fracking voters there. Their report should soon lead to other questions in some readers’ minds as well, such as: “Is it worth being snarky at the Keystone State misguidedly trying to shed itself of its longtime reputation of legislative corruption if even more news of the sex-for-political-ratings scandal that Daily Caller is using only as a political bludgeon?
Certainly a report by Michael Grunwald at Time.com does give me pause.
“Right now, taxpayer subsidies for flood insurance encourage Americans to live in harm’s way; the Obama Administration is trying to wean them off those subsidies, and Florida politicians are doing their best to fight off that culture change. So Washburn is worried that the plans her group has pioneered for deregulating solar panels or self-driving cars could be co-opted by the free-market movement, which seems to define its freedom as the absence of regulations. There are big holes in that movement, especially the big polluters who think they should get to put whatever they want in the air and water, and the people who moved onto the Mississippi coast without insuring themselves against hurricane risk and now want taxpayers to help pick up the tab. Washburn is a scientist, not a shill. But there’s also not much evidence that more carbon chaos would make the world safe for beachfront McMansions….”

Re “Trump’s Pollution Rules Reverse Is Called ‘Flawed’ ” (front page, Aug. 21):
Thank goodness some states and cities won’t give up the fight against climate change. Reducing automobile pollution is fundamental to easing the planet’s warming. Forty years of effort to build fuel-efficient, low-emissions cars and light trucks may go down the drain under the Trump administration’s proposal to freeze the emission standards. While air pollution has dramatically decreased in certain areas, in much of the country including the more conservative rural and small-town locations, pollution continues to take its toll on health and safety. In case we haven’t noticed, there is no real solution to “air pollution” but getting Americans back onto public transportation in all areas of the United States.

Supporters of the EPA’s clean power plan, in New York, Aug. 21, 2018. Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images
Several environmental groups are no longer asking red states whether they believe in the science of climate change (this is good, because many Republican voters want to see more action to curb pollution.) They’re now asking those in control of setting the power rules, “Do you believe in climate resilience?” and building climate adaptation into their proposals, Climatewire reports.
Why it matters: Resilience is about dealing with the impacts of climate change communities are already seeing, as opposed to curbing more emissions that could prevent worse results down the line. The paper notes neither side has stipulated how specifically they’re defining resilience, but it’s an issue both sides can claim too few regulations are addressing with enough attention.
It notes that proponents of this approach include ""a grantmaking initiative that works from the funder network Health and Environmental Funders toward chemical safety and climate solutions focusing on health, safety, equity considerations.""",0.16927937123303613,left

VW's ""dieselgate"" scandal forever changed how the world viewed convoys of commercially-traveled passenger cars. Particularly after the unraveling implicating Audi manufacturers, the automotive thumbprint seems easy to track. Regrettably and despite the gain recently promoted within the previoius Obama administration, big business interests are winning once more. Last Thursday, one day before Trump ex-epa administrator Palmer Creekoft recognized that the planet is a ""warmer place for all of us"", the current administration announced plans of scrapping President Obama's fuel standards which were expected to save at least 12 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions since their implementation in 2012. If the plan is seen through, ultimately the nation's drivers would find themselves spending approximately $500 billion more towards gas prices at the pump. The concrete suggestion to throw the proposal for stronger fuel efficiency until 2026 arrives in the form of a 979-page environmental impact statement order.
Delaware Senator Tom Carper, a member of the committee with oversight over federal vehicles’ energy use, had also weighed in with Reuters three months ago. ""The rest of the world is seeking to electrify and decarbonize the transportation sector, and we have the Trump administration putting the brakes on,"" he stated at that time.

Write a news article to explain pollution reduction.,"to fix frustrating pollution we need shared goals and measures of success.
There is evidence that pollution is annoying because it is invisible to the the individual but all too apparent at a societal level, meaning we increasingly live in a world where faith in shared institutions is replaced by almost manichaean attitudes.
Hopefully “Clean Your Future” signals a government commitment to releasing citizens and businesses from these tensions and offering the promise of collective success against shared challenges. The problem with too many activist proposals are “the Tragedy of the Commons” – a collective shift can break down quite quickly when there are still short-term advantages for some to “free ride” the shared change and break the agreement. Tackling climate change without the US on board is one problem practical problem allied to Donald Trump as there are more realists than idealists in both political camps in the US.
And George Osborne is said to have only eaten the leader of BlackBeard the Pirate in those inspired by tales from Witney to take resistance to those less than convinced of shared achievements to the bitter end. It is more than unlikely that the economies (let along voters) of South Korea or China will sacrifice economic advantage to help maintain the historical power of the country currently out of the economic driving seat. By contrast the “Race to the Top” elements of emissions trading schemes are one practical way for the economy as a whole to deploy broad resources of human ingenuity and productive capacity to solve the problem, or multiple problems, as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Evidently what a delivered future looks and smells like is slightly variable between different places and different people but it is governments providing a framework (the vision, policy, rules, information, powers and (hopefully at an affordable price) money to fund the activities necessary to bring frustrating problems in line with satisfactions and from there with relationships then community.
Meaningful measurements of environmental health are crucial for turning our shared narrative of past pollution and current climate risk into a future where creation of value (and so profit, although we care much more about the profits of the businesses that we own) is not an reflection of the harm that we do to body and soul. Initial and understandable confusion over the level of success that the National Emissions Ceilings being proposed by Michael Gove for the 2019 Environment Bill started with the misapplication of information from a Deloitte RetroSight report into the Policy Making Achievement in the UK on the the Environment to the effect that previous NAE efforts has been so effective that all 5 air quality pollutants are now in the green, save the most important one fine particulates (PM2.5) in the air we breathe.
These efforts have so far yielded roughly 12 reduction commitments
A Corrected Table 8 on page 28 shows that the legislation when combined with EU Directives has secured national achievement for SO 2 , NO X and non-methane hydrocarbon (NMVOC), although the last of these, together with NH 3 , increased for the year ended 31st December 2016 (5.4%) in the 5 years up to discuss in your specialist 12 to 16 July.

The position is ever so slightly cloudier for PM 10 , with the non-adjustment by the parts playing the major marketparison for “management and maintenance” of PM 10 watch in 2001 being offset by the actual decrease in PM 10 emissions by energy and industry (64-70% 1990-2011), comparison (70-73%) and… even the smallest (35-5%). However, I believe that the main answer is that the air quality ambitions of the last 20 – 25 years are, if anything, good instructions for target setting for the way that things will be. The data to show any advantages of opposition are unlikely to get a lot of air quality improvements from actions that will necessary for Brexit Minus I don’t know, I’m under pressure to make a decision on Brexit and implement policies for it, but how to not look convinced of harmful stuff that doesn’t happen and to take 5, 10 or even 20 years to clean up afterwards unless there is evidence it will benefit people now?
Except, it seems, for the objectively showable fact that some emissions ructions are relatively minor compared with the kettle of (HiStephent?) fish for sprint but are worth doing in county Metro Monsieur Addressee François Macron to avoid the High Step Augmented Parliamentarian, none of which remove the primary pollutant on the escape for faced walking to the debate on Beefroduction in France, seeing thebo 234 distracted by the final story in any that touted their…more and more species into…thing and in the process make a prickle, and the medium version ofóbóf… in Paris, spotted the “shelftäger has vowed to stop oil and continue up the… potentially 60 more prime Pyrenean flee pécorps tumbling down the mountain in its search”

NICHOLAS KAMM
Carlos Curbelo, the Republican congressman from Florida with a soft voice and soft-blue eyes, is to climate change what Larry Fink is to corporate governance or humblebrags are to Twitter: a unique and contemporary leader whose position capitalizes on a growing and undeniable shift in his respective field.
In Curbelo’s case, the shift is among Republicans who, per the latest Gallup poll, appear to be as attuned to the problem of global climate change as the rest of the world--a group that, when making political decisions, amounts to even fewer of its actual members on paper. The shift he embodies can also be found within the conference it never was less cool to join, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and its annual party, the Conference of the Parties, whose twenty-third meeting is taking place this week and next in Bonn, Germany. In a country where Republicans are no longer elected to top office in Democratic strongholds and Germany where, until last week, Germans had never seen a member of a far-right party in their parliament, a place like Bonn is where shifting conventions promise to have seismic impacts.
For now though, the Roar’ing twenties Curbelo and his peers--New York representative Elise Stefanik and Philadelphia area representative Ryan Costello (another Finkenthusiast)—are a rarity on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are the last pubic officials to defend dieselgate automakers and oppose clean energy to the point of Trumpian compromises. Yet, in a further departure from the Donald, who is at home on a penthouse’ roof or in a room full of wealthy donors, Curbelo’s roof has solar panels. It was climbing on those panels learners pace Congress prepared him to lead on cause unlike those his district one opposes, using their support for more stringent air-quality laws as an example of how partisans can agree on strategies to slow the changes they ought to agree are taking place.
Curbelo was hardly the first in the party to publicly acknowledge the reality that a burning atmosphere makes itself felt on the ground he walks. Christiana Figueres, architect of the Paris Conference, described a late April meeting at the Capitol where Republican senators Susan Collin, Robin Graham, and John McCain made it clear that they intended to make Frank the COP leader Curbelo was striving to be. Fifty-one days after the meet up, the congressman announced his caucus. And nearly thirty years before either of them came out, much of Washington did too. The difference between then and now is, back then politicians admitted as much and in 1989, after ten years and a once-unimaginable increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes, Congress tackled the irixtax equivalent of the climate change, the problem of acid rain.

Write a news article to share a fact about pollution reduction.,"former head of epa suggests climate change ""might help"" to reduce pollution.
Asked last month to react to the Trump administration's climate report, which painted a grim picture of how a warmer world impacts the United States, Donald Trump said, ""I don't believe it.""
And while it's tempting to dwell on the Republican president's ludicrous anti-science posture, it's important to note he's not alone. Officials from Trump World were eager to tell the public that in the administration's rejection of the report, the president was reflecting the thinking of officials throughout the sprawling federal bureaucracy.
The Wall Street Journal published a related report, noting in passing that a former, high-ranking official offered a unique rationale for why climate change may not be so bad after all.
Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who left the agency July 6 after a bruising stretch in the national media but earned plaudits from conservatives, informed a Senate hearing in January that the ""crucial"" question for him is whether humans ""contribute"" to climate change. He said that ""science tells us that we do,"" but not by how much.
Mr. Pruitt has suggested recently that concern about the impact of climate pollutants might be overstated. He said in a TV interview that temperatures are not rising. He also told lawmakers that researchers don't fully know how to measure global warming.
In fairness, the Journal's article published this morning did not make excuses for Pruitt's pseudo-science. But it was Scott Pruitt, and not Donald Trump, who suggested climate conditions may not be quite as bad as advertised.
And in case that weren't quite enough, there was Pruitt's even more amazing Reuters interview yesterday.",0.1744462908633674,left

To the editor: I enjoyed Gustavo Arellano’s humorous column on U-Haul truck drivers who have a beef with the Mexican state of Michoacan. I also agree with him that the logic used to anchor the lawsuit by the Little Sisters of the Poor to avoid requirements that their employees be covered for contraceptives is weak. (“El Pueblo Pocho,” July 10)
Religious groups that reject almost any form of contraception should be exempt. Catholic Healthcare West adheres to Catholic teachings and has a policy that prohibits coverage for elective abortions, but it does provide coverage for all forms of contraception because it serves people of all faiths and beliefs.
The “Little Sisters” should abandon their lawsuit. The current policy accommodates their religious beliefs in a pluralistic society.
Jun Allen, Palm Springs
..
To the editor: Now that the Little Sisters of the Poor have exposed the ridiculous and onerous requirements of Obamacare, I expect that the public and media will similarly chide opponents of religious conscience protections and legal accommodations for businesses that decline participation in same-sex ceremonies.
Just as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case brought by the sisters that the government’s intrusive mandate in health insurance coverage and the other available workarounds reveal its lack of “compelling interest” in protecting employee contraceptive rights rather than allowing these nuns a religious accommodation, so too opponents of “license to discriminate” laws and their public backers show their lack of “compelling interest” when there are alternatives for minorities to secure the cake, photography or flowers for unions.
I hope that all state protections for gay people from discrimination will be repealed just as Obamacare regulations will be following the conscience objections of the sisters, not to mention for-profit corporations, schools and colleges.

This story shows the impact of climate change, but not in the way we expect. It’s not couched in widespread devastation wrought by a natural disaster made stronger by global warming; instead, a drought has led to sinks suddenly empty of declining water supplies. It forces adaptation, rolling-out short-term solutions like meals on wheels for example, that ultimately rely on the pollutions causing it.
Global Warming Didn’t Make The Dabbawalas Adopt The Indian Textile Industry’s Quaint Delivery System.
Another story also highlights climate change’s surprising effects: the dabbawalas, the Mumbai-based messengers behind the efficient delivery service mentioned above, have adopted an age-worn delivery system used by India’s textile industry before partition. It may seem bizarre that such emaciated hangers-on to the textile-industry relic, now that Mumbai-based factories have since dissolved their contracts and other coat hangers were used, are nonchalantly moving goods via a wooden bike. But when painted against the backdrop of sweltering high temperatures made higher by earth’s warming climate, their delivery system may be tossed aside in the name of efficiency and profit—at a great loss: the wooden bikes and ancient textile-industry delivery system included, these wooden bikes may seem outmoded but in the face of increased urbanization and an already rushing movement towards automation, uniforms are hung at the ends of poles carried by two workers instead of three or four in the textile industry, the dabbawalas may have actually adopted efficient and entirely green transport.
The wood bike would probably be replaced by a more efficient, less appealing but climate-conscience mode of transporting the same load: a city’s worth of canted sleeping cars powered by a moving truck that way traffic lights have less of an effect on the frequency of road careen.

Write a news article to share a fact about green technology.,"australia's greenhouse gas emissions rise again, driven by LNG production.
Boosting sustainability technologies The C-PACE program will help put Boston on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, a goal outlined in the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change. These improvements will also help Boston reach Mayor Walsh’s three-year targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings 50% by 2025 and 70% by 2050. Additionally, the program will produce good jobs and save building owners money on their energy bills. This is truly a win-win solution to revitalizing our aging infrastructure. Boston plans to invest $100 million in the first four years of the program to help leverage $500 million in energy project investment.
2018 has seen increases in the carbon emissions intensity of Australia’s liquefied natural gas production, with federal government projections for the fuel’s production removed from the latest Emissions Projections report at the last minute.
The report, released this week by the Department of the Environment and Energy, shows that Australia remains dramatically off course for meeting the emissions reduction targets it set under the Paris agreement, and that emissions from the electricity sector will be effectively unchanged over the next 12 years.
However, it was emissions from Australia’s export-focused LNG industry, an energy sector where the government has consistently advised that it was expecting only increased efficiency and reduced intensity of production, that drove up this year’s trend figures.
Promised $1bn by Coalition, Labor says it will double renewable energy agency Read more
In consequence, the report – which was expected to be released more than a month ago – had to be altered at the 11th hour on Tuesday to remove analysis and projections designed to back up that claim. Specifically, the government took out references to so-called “commonwealth decision maker” estimates.
The emissions intensity of Queensland exports – much of them LNG – rose by 95% in 2016-17 and continued increasing this year, even despite the removal of incentives for it to do so through a ban on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation funding coal and the Abbott government’s so-called “green bank”

Greens climate spokesman Adam Bandt told Guardian Australia he would be referring the passages to the energy minister, Angus Taylor, for approval to be tabled.
A minister, or the prime minister, can invoke public interest immunity to prevent information being disclosed, if they believe its publication will cause injury to the public interest that is greater than the “public interest” in its disclosure.
After Peter Dutton’s near miss, Liberals panic over who they can parachute into safe seats Read more
In a parliamentary speech, Bandt said it was clear the information about the impact of the government’s decision making on LNG was deliberately removed “so as not to embarrass the minister for emissions increases”.
He said the fact the documents had been reviewed and then removed would prompt questions about what the government knew about the climate impact of exporting gas and when.
According to the Climate Council, Pacific Island countries have repeatedly asked Australia to “formally quarantine the development of new fossil fuel industries, such as coal and unconventional gas, and associated infrastructure, such as coal mining, coal ports and coal-fired power plants”.
The removal of the decision maker estimates mark the second time in a matter of weeks that a significant piece of climate policy has had to be delayed because of gas industry pressures. On the day the national energy guarantee was rejected by Coalition MPs on 10 August, following a campaign led by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, the government instead brought to cabinet the ACCC’s report into “retail electricity prices” which included the final report of its analysis into the east coast gas market.
Unsurprisingly, the gas “simscum” did little to drive gas-powered electricity unemployment, with zero disconnections at load factors where they were capable of nominally doing so Illustration: Department of the Environment and Energy
The report found that the reason gas prices in Australia have reached global parity is LNG exports, and not state-based bans on onshore production. Nevertheless, business and industry groups welcomed its findings, with some pushing for the adoption of an uncertain, and very expensive “signal to market” that could encourage east coast producers to supply more gas to Australian buyers before meeting its pre-existing LNG contracts.
According to the government, the delays in the report were the result of administrative failings that led to a situation where the documents including the estimated emissions intensity had not in fact been finally endorsed. On Tuesday departmental officials were unable to explain how a full sectional analysis could be made of in-principle decisions, if the in principle decisions had not in fact been further scrutinised later in the process.",0.16939909853196392,left

Write a news article to highlight biodiversity loss.,"we are now seeing the reality of climate instability | letters.
Your editorial (22 May) is typical of the attitude of The Guardian and the BBC towards global climate change, without mentioning measures to mitigate its effects. The editorial refers to the crisis of nature as a “doomsday” scenario when, in fact, we now have chicken come home to roost in the form of extreme weather events becoming the norm, likely to lead to increasing extremes of average temperature on the planet, records of maximum daily temperatures being consistently broken, an increase in atmospheric humidity giving rise to floods of added severity, cloud bursts and therefore the severity of hurricanes, increasing atmospheric pressure with more areas descending into the troposphere, leading to jet streams remaining in place for far longer periods than the “norm” leading to the increased likelihood of drought and the introduction of a world-wide water shortage, with huge concomitant human suffering. The 2017 report by the governments’ chief scientific adviser Sir Mark Walport and his US counterpart Prof Peter Wadhams warned that action on pollution was needed to safeguard continued food supplies and avoid social unrest. That such advice is ignored by all governments world wide, with even Britain having the audacity to cut subsidies to renewable energy forms, to fund the HS2 rail link, reveals that few senior administrators of energy production have a grasp of even O level physics as an unfortunate fact.

Some Americans are more likely to get their feelings hurt by a small tax than they are by actual problems.
That's what some economists found when they conducted a survey asking more than 5,000 Americans how they feel about raising revenue though broadening the base of the sales tax, rather than raising overall rates that apply to the things you buy. The researchers published the results in a working paper circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
More Women Say They've Been Harassed At Work .
Can They Change That?
: NPR
They found something surprising — a lot of people generally oppose broadening the base of a sales tax. But the strongest opposition ""comes from people who are really unlikely to benefit from these reforms in a meaningful way,"" says the study's first author, Todd Rogers, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School who researches behavioral insights to help solve social problems.
White people, men, high-income people and more highly-educated people were most likely to oppose making changes to the sales tax to raise more money for their government, his analysis found. People under 55 tended to be more supportive of tax reform than older people.
Researchers asked respondents to consider a state with a budget shortfall and a few options to raise more money. People were more likely to accept the broadening of a sales tax base when the new revenue went to one of two purposes — education, and environmental protection — that many people believe benefit everyone.
But broadening the sales tax base to eliminate ""upward wealth transfers"" — tax breaks — or to close state budget deficits in order to cover the shortfalls of underfunded public pensions elicited the lowest levels of acceptance. Older people feeling the sting is consistent with research on American attitudes toward other government entitlement programs.
Perhaps state and local governments who might consider changing their tax codes could get people on board if they helped low-income people to understand why that might be helpful to them, Rogers says.

Yet much of this momentum has centered on widely visible actions—public transport, renewable energy, year-round biking initiatives—while climate adaptation strategies, often already in place but insufficient in reach and scale, are like the missing middle child of climate change action.
The contrast was on full, acute display this April at the 2nd International Climate Change Adaptation (Adaptation Futures) Conference in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Conference halls overflowed with experts from across the world, across varying expertise (from urban planning to agriculture systems), and the gamut of human experience. Collectively, they had in common profound, piercing insight into a question forming an existential enigma for our world: how do cities, farmers, fishermen, you, me, and every single layer of human society adjust to maintain their well-being amidst rapid, continued, and increasingly adverse effects of climate change?
Adaptation was front and center at the convocation, with representatives from non-government organizations, governments, and citizens pushing the discussion and action forward; yet, brief glimmers of recognition stand in stark, pitiful contrast to the disproportionate strength of the visible. An aspect of human nature or skewed media representation? Director of the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and conference co-director for Research Dr. Claudia Sadoff wrote in a press release, “Adaptation is the most effective way of dealing with climate change. There’s a clear need for more robust data, better tools, and, importantly, political will to drive solutions that can protect and improve the livelihoods of millions of the most climate-affected people around the world.” Yet as insights on new technologies for climate change mitigation and low emission technologies made the rounds, climate adaptation conversations too buzzed with potential for access to ""new sources of financing for adaptation technologies"".
Outside the conference walls, 'new' breeds have sprung up as nature's repository of naturally drought-proof or sea level rise-adapted crops plays LCD to high-flying research on genetically engineered drought-tolerant trees. Innovative fantasy (growing vegetables without water, living under glass bubbles), small-scale realities, and lessons learned skipped hand-in-palm in various aspects of water management, agriculture, and environmental planning. Not only do burgeoning programs grow high-school gardens amidst previously vacant plots where flipped SUVs once lay after Hurricane Katrina; other nascent efforts underscore the need for thorough planning as they invite displaced hurricane survivors to eat healthier but less flavorful diets of local, organically-grown gubenatóm—Romanized Kreyol for 'grub'—as post-disaster plan and dietary supplement.
Overwhelmingly, though, the conversation was dominated by the proverbial thorn in the side—albeit on a rhetorical scale where 'thorn in the side’ signaled that which might mean the difference between living by the coast as even wings of water lapped up large tracks of India or dawdling while giddily raising the media frenzy and venture capitalism as drones for mine and your very pettier of apps.
""It's not enough to only focus on solar panels or electric cars. To minimize the effects of climate change, we also need to focus on and drive more climate-change adaptation solutions,"" reads a Newswire press-release.
To be clear: the counterforce to climate change necessitates larger, actively proportionate acknowledgement and responses to the effects of the change we bring upon our environments and ecosystems than we currently allow in our policy discussions and programming, investment approaches and personal actions. Nonetheless, such misreprentations in language and action ship the balance further of what would have otherwise been a stormy but poised vessel for collective climate action into disparate waters.
Adaptation: a concept and programming approach lost and found in conflicting interpretation and, as with the rearing of any two antipodal issues through the looking lens of human incentives and priorities, a myriad errors in action that bring humanity farther from the purpose with every step but which threaten the integrity of intent and fair measure as they exist not for neglect of the above conclusion but despite it. Wolf-crying allegations of green-washing, aid mutliation, and cherry-picking problems to suit wage-maintaining siloes of specialization (which seem expansive to the sender/receivers in the blink span between crises and more so when walkways crumble post-haste around them) reverbrated amidst otherwise concordant voices.
How do we right the balance, lest teaching the missing middle child aspect by allowing a world to swing dizzyingly on purposeful negligence, profligate misinformation, and frenetic shove to undo young childhood be compensated only with the other shift in what should be steadier ground, for reasons single to an anthrobody too matearlerial and sensory to parse into?

Write a news article to highlight climate change adaptation.,"alec’s super-commonsense statement on doj’s climate lawsuit.
An unrelated, never-enforced provision in a nearly 80-year-old environmental protection law is the sole basis for a federal appeals court to assert appellate jurisdiction over a catalog of petitions challenging an Obama administration climate regulation, the Trump administration said in its opening merits brief last week. That separation-of-powers violation is reason enough for the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate the D.C. Circuit’s stay of the regulation and to remand with instructions to the lower court to remand to EPA the petition challenging the regulation and to dismiss it for lack of judicial jurisdiction.
Briefing was completed on Aug. 8 for two Obama administration rules promulgated in 2015 and challenged by virtually every state, the coal industry, power companies, and the coal and utility unions. The bases of all the challenges to the CO 2 regulation were outlined in the first sentence of the first paragraph in the Trump administration’s opening merits brief strikingly titled “Merit Brief For Respondents In No. 17-949”:
This case involves a challenge to the Obama administration’s 2015 regulation establishing emission standards for existing fossil fuel-fired power plants. As part of the regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency offered states and localities a menu of policy changes that would result in reduced CO 2 emissions associated with electric power generation nation-wide. The principal challengers contend that the 2015 rule exceeds the agency’s statutory authority by not allowing them to adhere to the Obama administration’s preferred list of policies instead.
In the very next sentence was an explanation that, if true, should be enough for the Supreme Court to grant the petition in this case:
This brief explains why the D.C. Circuit lacked jurisdiction to review such challenges in the first instance.
That explanation is not just about the specifics of the federal Clean Air Act or about the “roadmap” that the U.S. Department of Justice paints and follows from start to finish in this brief.
That explanation explicitly acknowledges a fundamental principle of both fairness and separation of powers – the rule of law. For those of us who believe in a Tyranny of Law, it’s about time that reason, this concept – that the laws must be enforced impartially and fairly and that our rights are protected by written, objective laws capable of helping us foresee and thereby avoid liability – gets through, if at least for one breath by one administration.",0.7304962115983168,right

Re “Warming Pushes Closer to a Catastrophic Tipping Point” (front page, Nov. 27):
The latest climate change treaty, the 2015 Paris accord, is a series of voluntary goals. Many countries, including the United States, have already announced plans to come up short. Humanity is without hope if our only solution is to leave drastic changes to the individual choice of each of the 7.7 billion of us.
We have no Planet B if we spoil this one. To truly affect environmental change, there is only one moral response: to voluntarily not have children. That is the perfect individual response. All other lifestyle choices are much less effective.
I understand that such a strategy will not be popular. Society will never adopt it. But that is exactly the problem.

The overall number of people killed in such disasters, however, dropped to about 5,400 in 2016 from 101,000 in 2006 because of better preparedness. “Lower numbers of deaths are not enough, given greater concentration of physical value at risk,” the report said.
Economic losses associated with climate-related disasters have soared in recent years. For the 20 years from 1997 to 2016, the Aon Benfield data shows a total of $3.7-trillion in losses from all disasters, with $1.88-trillion of that sum linked to climate-related incidents.
Though wildfires aren’t driven by climate change, rising temperatures overall have made blazes more severe, especially in drought-prone areas.
This was highlighted earlier in the year as the uninsured losses from large forest fires in Alberta, Canada, where $3.5-billion, making it the costliest disaster in Canadian history. Fuelling the blaze was unseasonably dry weather and high heat.

This past year was a bad one for agriculture. Between winter storm Grayson in January, and the so-called ""bomb cyclone"" in March, this winter was as severe a one-two punch as they come.
Sub-zero temperatures and the flooding they caused have been responsible for what the Department of Agriculture called a ""catastrophic loss"" for farmers in the Great Plains. And the untimely late season blizzard in the Northern Plains that killed 47,000 cattle and things yet another on its head.
Altogether, the damage estimates run in the billions of dollars — particularly on the central plains. And farmers are on the front lines of the climate change battle.
So we would like to hear from farmers or those with a deep knowledge of how climate change trends have affected farming generally where you live: What specific problems have you experienced, and what tweaks, if any, have you had to make to your planting and reaping seasons in order to compensate?

In early April, during Mark Zuckerberg’s hearing before Congress, Sen. Udall interrogated him about the possible environmental implications of Facebook’s deliberate dissemination of fake news about climate change. “I worry about the next generation of kids,” Udall said, “growing up and getting a lot of information on this and not really learning about the benefit of addressing these kinds of social challenges and health challenges and environmental challenges.”
Udall is hoping education can be part of the solution to one of the greatest challenges confronting humanity. For the new school year that begins this month, he has introduced legislation with a historic, if narrow, purpose: to give public school systems and federal education officials an asteroid bump to beef up the nation’s most famous environmental education program:
We owe it to America’s kids to provide them with more opportunities to create and sustain school gardens, in-class lessons, and youth stewardship programs and projects.
Introduced in 1990 by Udall’s father, also a New Mexico congressman at the time, the National Environmental Education Act first authorized the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to create a national program that would allow it to give grants to school systems and communities throughout the country, essentially nationalizing the private programs and philanthropic grants of the country’s myriad municipalities, that mothers and local environmental organizations activists and organizations have made to facilitate environmental education, literacy, stewardship and community service in public and private schools and libraries throughout the country.

The occupation of up-and-coming urban spaces worldwide is leading to an increase in rats, which is concerning since they’re vectors of deadly diseases. In Bismarck, rats are kept at bay through vigilant code enforcement and inspection that keeps the city as unappetizing to them as possible.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides guidance to city and county health departments identifying the need for rat control, including reducing the abundance of their food, water, and harborages. Rat populations can recover quickly from poisoning off, so the approach is considered less effective than creating a less welcoming habitat.
Bismarck has a rat eradication program that could be a model for Great Plains cities. “The high number of complaints received annually indicates this to be a continuing and pressing issue in the City of Bismarck,” notes the department. On the other hand, “This is an impressive accomplishment and demonstrates that the City of Bismarck has cut down on conditions that are considered necessary for the survival of Norway rats.”

""But even in the absence of American leadership ... I'm confident that our states, cities and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we"" have, said Obama, who did not mention Trump by name. ""The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. The United States should be at the front of the pack.""
In a call with reporters, Obama senior adviser Brian Deese said, unequivocally, that the deal was not dead.
""Trump's decision will be identified by the world for what it is ― an aggressive effort to dismantle the progress we have made on a changing climate at considerable cost to our ability to promote our economic interests and way of life,"" he said.
Under the terms of United Nations regulations, the U.S. would not have officially been able to withdraw from the agreement until the day after the 2020 presidential election. Because the deal was controversial by design (each country's commitments are ""nationally determined,"" meaning they are not legally binding and are not subject to collective enforcement), the Obama administration had sought the agreement of the major industrialized nations to the pact in order to support the participation of major developing countries.
Brazil, a major emerging economic power and the globe's most populous Portuguese-speaking nation, has long been proud of taking on the role of spokesman on climate change for the world's less developed nations. The European Union praised the Paris Agreement as a ""historic landmark"" and a turning point. In an interview, Magno Maciel, the head of the Brazilian delegation to six-way negotiations within the United Nations on the subject, stated that the actions of Trump would likely give China a greater role in coordinating the global dialogue on the environment.
Japan, an industrial giant with 125 million people that is the world's third-largest economy and fifth-largest greenhouse gas emitter, urged other members of the group to ""unite without a crack."" Both China and the European Union also offered reluctant support for trade groups negotiating a massive Pacific-wide trade deal that some members were on the verge of abandoning.",0.5318016627182562,right

Hurricane Irma is powerful, but the loss of life isn't as great as it might have been because of human improvements to the environment.
The Two-Way
Droughts And Flooding Are Climate Change Drivers
When natural disaster strikes once, energy and endurance, adaptation and stick-to-it-ness go a long way with recovery. But what about the second, third or fourth time around?
A recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists finds that, by the end of the century, some 170 U.S. coastal cities will run smack into the reality of a warming planet: they'll experience at least 26 times more frequent flooding than they do today, and at depth.
Before we cross that eventual high water mark, should the the specter of more severe, stormy weather serve as a proxy for what real estate in those high flood-risk areas might be worth in the decades to come?",0.47750280991507077,center
