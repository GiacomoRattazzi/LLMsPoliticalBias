The manifesto dataset is available on this link: https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/

To get the dataset through the api, an account on the website should be created. The API key is then available in the profile page. 

'api_calls.py' gathers all manifestos from the US. To run it, line 3 should be modified to include the API key. Line 82 could be modified to gather manifestos from other countries.
