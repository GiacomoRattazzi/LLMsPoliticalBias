'compare_Titles.py' and 'compare_url.py' are used to find identical articles between the POLUSA dataset and the dataset used for training PoliticalBiasBert.

'Removing_matches.py' removes those overlapping articles from the POLUSA dataset.

'LeaningArticles.py' filter articles with a specific political stance (Line 9 can be changed to obtain other political leanings).

'ClimateChangeArticles.py' filters the articles to only keep the ones containing 'climate change' in the headline.
