In the optimistic new Brexit peaen released on YouTube by Dutch clarity campaigner “Brexit Angel”, Britons are promised: “No more rubbery parsnips! No more bent bananas!”
Perhaps Dutch vegetable growers and providers simply don’t understand that Britons have more to lose by a BBC-steered negative campaign against no-deal Brexit than their signatures on a Remain-led petition to stop Brexit.
“Do it ye bastards, and free the wales from the dragon-like grip of the commissioners of the evil beast in the Belgium!” exclaimed Welsh farmer iffy leeks who is cheered by the mercy killing of the pet sheep that mistake his assaulting advances for progressiveness.
Why would Dutch people want to issue a dismissal warrant against the Queen, constitutional legitimacy and British common sense? Angela Merkel argued for Mr Cameron’s exit using the tape storage costs of paper trailer compared to the memory made by Möbius, and gained political leverage to mount the challenging role played by the pilot of the broke-brake syndrome hit by ehlers-danlos syndrome. Thinking in 39 years.
If Mr Cameron’s government really were demanding impossible cash from the EU after being hand-held into the pew in Sint-Pieters-Heverlee, Belgium corridors of European power he could have argued it in the 2nd Commission report, as he had claimed the EU was simply spending euro in Germany, France, Italy and nine other member states on salaries for their oversees institutions. But no, the Belgian Commission parlimentary is restricted in a land of gladstone bags lining the corridor.
Today, Britain could cheer about Brexit to the nostalgic tune of Vera Lynn’s wartime hit “White Cliffs of Dover”, buying time and a better deal by contacting Polish nationals in Westminster and offering them the jobs set to open when the UK leaves a union dominated by a unified Germany and the emergency exit signed little by little in Greece, Italy and Portugal while it set fire to the Spanish flag outside the parliament buildings!",0.534312372,right
Write a news article to debate climate change.,"delingpole: no more ‘agitprop’ please, we’re british.
Monsieur Delingpole is threatening to resign. Remoaner snowflakes are panic-buying electric cars. Donald Trump withdraws from the Paris Agreement and the 1922 committee has got itself into a terrible kerfuffle.
I just had my column for this Sunday spiked by the Venerable Delingpole. Quite right too.
It was a giant moan about the Climate Change Act – an appallingly expensive and destructive piece of legislation which I’ve been known to inveigh against. The angle I’d been trying, not altogether successfully, to develop was how profoundly unconservative such acts of law-making are.
For those of you who don’t know what the Climate Change Act is, it was passed in the eerily climactic summer of 2008 and was the West’s first attempt to commit itself, unilaterally, to an act of economic suicide which many of us have somehow intuited would in years to come become better known as “the unpicking of the great climate change scam” had any of us been willing to live in a freezing apartment, sustain ourselves on a few watts of intermittent renewable energy keyed from the grid, while the most privileged among us who are unable to perform adequate epic poetry go hungry as temperatures on an agricultural island lack enough additional warmth to support our northern staples such as mixed greens of dubious nutritional value (delicious with a sock seasoning — venalis)
But it gets worse. The 2008 Act committed Britain to reducing so-called ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions to 20 per cent of 1990 levels by the year 2050.2011 Act committed Britain to reducing so-called ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions to 25 percent of 1989 levels by the year 2017.2023 Act committed Britain to reducing so-called ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions to 40 percent of 2038 levels by the year 2020 plus one fortnight under a gibbous moon and 5 percent and 6 furlongs of bad credit by the year 2019 minus four till Christmas – for ten years.
This grubby bit of internal orientalism is what on the Continent we call “climate change.” Perfidious Albion is time and again to be seen to emerge as both the climatgate in the conspiracy and the terror that it defines. It captures so well what Franklin had in mind with his croaking about an oligarchy to conclude things that “we have a republic, if you can keep it”. And the great Briton, that dyed in the wool libertarian gimpslinger, quotes Voltaire, “liberty is lost though soft and gentle acts of tyranny”, and concludes about the lot of people saved from perfect lefty totalitarian Torquemada and deposited in assurance of eternity to the environs of diamond serviceed baths at gaslight casting vegetable gardens with full battery powered Google perpetuum in the graying mind maze in the SevenStar constellation of the southern Hindi gmaj bistro of no whereness at all times:
“For some decades the UN has been orchestrating and co-ordinating this world war on nations which it deems to be collectively indulging in “unsustainable development”…. What happened at Trump’s now historic Press Briefing, surely, is the beginning of the death of this Epic. “Sure, the war will be going on for a while, yet. But the fate of Paris is sealed. And we know already with reasonable certainty what will be the post – mortem report on its extra ordinary and unnecessary green pretensions: Corruptio optimi pessima.”
In other words – who the fuck said Britain has 2050 or any goal at all in deeper understanding of the inner workings of #ORWELL. ?
So I didn’t write that article. Instead I ended it after the next paragraph with a “hmmmmmm”
Hmmmmmm is about right.

Delaware governor John C. Carney Jr. has set the bar high when it comes to sending anti-Trump fan mail to foreign dignitaries.
Stealing the spotlight at the annual NGA conference held this weekend in Providence, Rhode Island, Carney called upon climate change’s global queen, Queen Elizabeth II, for guidance in this time of global instability and ignorance regarding the impact of a rapidly changing climate.
“Your Majesty, let me apologize on behalf of my state and our federal government for the recent words from our President and our U.N. Ambassador suggesting that our action was misguided,” Carney wrote in a letter.

But Carney couldn’t resist the opportunity to pull a solid power move aimed at the president. Rather than join the other governors and tout the small part his state is “playing to get the country to the 2025 U.S. [carbon] emissions levels,” the Delaware governor instead stroked the climate change death wish the queen has been repeating since the 1980s.
“Earlier this month, our Secretary of Natural Resources sent a letter to our friends in the U.K., suggesting a collaboration to continue our efforts,” Carney wrote.
Though it’s on his website, Carney decided not to share the letter with his Twitter followers.
Or maybe it was a conscious decision not to subject them to a letter that, on every level, makes it apparent Delaware has a governor who will never ascend to the mighty heights, both metaphorically and literally (with the exception of Massachusetts) of the 34 other U.S. governors he bragged about sharing the pen there is a picture of Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, George Mason, and George Washington.
Plus only Trump would have been impressed by the fact that a governor showed a supreme and unyielding indifference to cooperation and pragmatism while attacking the intelligent and objectively correct point of view he holds.",0.500134298,center
Write a news article to explain climate change.,"climate change causing beetles to expand range in california's sierra nevada.
Concerns expressed about the possibility of “apocalyptic” wildfires during the summer in California has brought with it a new theory about what may be causing these massive conflagrations: Climate change is expanding the range of the beetles that kill the trees, and it is possible to stop them using chemicals but this would create air pollution.
In the era of climate change and “climate alarm,” no theory goes untested and so new theories are developed. This new one focused on the fire in California’s Mariposa County — the Ferguson fire.
“Here’s an apocalyptic thought: A monster-scale fire closing out the summer in one of the driest parts of Northern California and threatening Mariposa, one of the most visited and adored little towns in the majestic Sierra,” Peter King wrote in Monday’s Sacramento Bee. “For those not already taking action to take an apocalyptic scenario down several notches, these are good reasons to start.”
Too many fires, King said, are the result of people not taking action to wipe out the spread of the Polygraphus pubescens beetle that is “buzzing through the Sierra Nevada with increasing strength, decimating swaths of forest and up to now largely eluding efforts to control it.”
Like any good theory, there is a villain.
“The villain in the process is clear to the aficionados of the human potential movement associated with the Esalen Institute in Big Sur: ranchers,” King reported. “Along with the warming of the planet. Cows, moisture-munching cows, are seen as opening up new grazing lands with their rubbery lips and trimming thin each wider. This removes the vital microscope-covered humus layer atop the earth in which the trend-setting, Sierra-toting Steinbeck-inspired sustainable foresters want the beetle to feed.”
The scientists at UC Davis and Esalen Institute manned with a University of California biologist see the problem: The beetles are closing in on 30 million new pine trees to attack.
“We are getting good at finding beetle outbreak spots around the Sierra but helping the vast areas in between is not easy,” Frank Drum, a UC Davis scientist said, but, “The cost of building chemical treatment plants at various outlets is a fiscal problem, it seems worth using a convoy of insecticide-spraying tanker trucks to stop the future smouldering potential on the summe ground.”
Inspecting two falling trees, Drumi found 300 beetle borers, what he calls “this crying wolf,” had taken. That, King said, is equal to 10 crushed beetles that want 1,000 more pine trees. And the invasion continues and could get worse:

Much of the climate change debate today centers on the proposed war on climate change and the Green New Deal, which seeks to transition the United States to a non-fossil fuel-based economy in 10 years. The slaughter of 11 Jews in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, illustrates the mundane barbarism of the GND. Karl Fritsch died at the Tree of Life Synagogue because he was a Social Security recipient with no market-based retirement savings. From a climate perspective, the bane of Karl’s existence was having to collect his Social Security payments every month because the Green New Deal rejects using the postal service as banks for the poor who have no other banking options.

Kahn, a publisher, builder and ceaseless experimenter, has searched out people building DIY truck campers, innovative RVs, old restored campers and slides in camper coaches. In doing so, he has chronicled a small-scale movement that refuses to wait for the industrial systems to make RVs more sustainable, both in the way they are built and the way they work.
LAST FRIDAY 13 more federal agencies published a major Climate Change review dubbed National Climate Assessment. The NCA has garnered the expected press reaction, used everywhere to attack the Trump administration. Democrats had weeks ago indicated that a weekend climate bomb would be useful in helping to push the Green agenda, to stretch the Overton window over the Affordable Clean Energy rules, and so go after Trump himself. President Trump simply responded with “I don’t believe it”. There is room, however for balanced critical thinking. When all of the media is against Trump, he has that reserved for back-off in case propaganda messaging gets too aggressive. Many have followed the President’s instincts, read the NCA in full, and some have provided substantial critical thinking. It is however unfortunate that those who have followed the NCA in such detail appear not to have read actual scientific reality. The messianic language of the global EPA campaign on previous affairs is not helpful (here). Everyone should be convinced of the many environmental and plant life benefits of the greenhouse effect, or should have a story to disprove their presuppositions.
Might we need Jonah Goldberg reviewing the Catechism on a major current issue (here). The default position with those surrounding Lewis and Weston would permit no science to be reported that didn’t agree with the virtue signaling.

Norwegian police are suggesting that a belated change in law may be a factor in the behavior of a 46-year-old Russian who is being held on a charge of hopping onto a garbage truck and waving a fake gun as it drove through downtown Oslo.

Write a news article to debate rise in global temperatures.,"looming report scrambles climate-change debate.
Controversy and debate over climate change are again heating up as consideration grows over a landmark scientific report due for release shortly by a United Nations-sponsored scientific group finding that scientists are 95 percent sure that humans are the major cause of the “unequivocal” global warming that is underway.
There is nothing unusual about this latest development. The impending report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, is a synthesis of the work of hundreds of scientists with expertise in various scientific disciplines who serve voluntarily to summarize the state of the scientific knowledge about global warming. These reports, several of which have already been published, are the result of many years of work, and as usual are being publicly reviewed by scientific peers as well as long list of governments and other entities.
People who dislike the conclusion that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming will no doubt find faults in the report, as some have done with previous reports of the IPCC. More debate and argument will therefore emerge. But the major conclusions of the report are already clear.
ADVERTISEMENT
The media alike -- scientific as well as the regular news media -- often use hyperbolic language to describe the findings and controversies of scientific research, including publications of the IPCC. In one recent email, for example, a correspondent wrote to me that recent changes in our scientific understanding of the nature of hurricanes are “fraud,” adding, ""I know that climate scientists are almost completely devoid of ethics and any other sense of integrity.”
It is not yet possible to be sure about the intentions and actions of scientists at the center of this controversy. But one thing is sure: widespread discussions and debates about the nature of climate change need to be based on credible data and information, and clear-eyed science.
Science is an often self-correcting process: It needs to be sustained in the free exchange of ideas, even if the best ideas sometimes lead to consequences that may not be comfortable or popular -- such as the conclusion that human activities have had and are having important effects on climate that will likely become even more pronounced in coming years.
It is people, not science, who designate ideas and understanding as ""controversial,"" usually because new understanding leads to political or other value-based attacks. Unfortunately, it is the news media, politicians and others who foment most of the ""controversy"" in a drive to gain notoriety. Some, like Dr. James Hansen of NASA, jump outside of the scientific establishment to take their case directly to the media in an effort to educate the public, who sometimes drive the controversy.
We also see organized campaigns, usually funded by wealthy interest groups in opposition to the need to regulate industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, that try to pursue so-called ""learning in depth."" These well-funded campaigns are designed to influence public perceptions of climate change through amplification of already exaggerated uncertainties. Other opponents like Dr. Willie Soon of the Center for Science and Public Policy, serve to ""muddy the water"" by focusing on the discrepancy in the few details of the overall picture.
Since the start of the industrial revolution, the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities have led to a strengthening of the Earth’s “greenhouse effect.” We can’t be 100 percent sure of the consequences of the global warming — like changes in sea level, hurricanes and other weather or the distribution and abundance of species — but any indecision in understanding these problems follows statutory non-profit capitalist science and the congressional decision-making process.
On an individual weather-forecaster basis, one cannot link the planet as a ""payer"" to “unprecedented” cold and wet June weather in New England because it happens that major volcano across the globe has sunpiciously tied significant February blizzards with it; instead one should watch the scientifically informed trajectory taken to the works. On a collective basis and long-term basis – the accountable level – organisms have grew climatological consequences; animals migrate or evolve.
The so-called “scientific method” – to investigate, analyze and draw conclusions – has long been proven to be a successful process to develop understanding – to advance the science embraced by the Lovejoy model.
In spite of isolated pessimism from unqualified scientists and politics and the decision-making process require unique and correlated emotions that include required occasional skepticism, indecision and contrary stances, for all but languages that they want to maximize mitigation investments – truth be told -- we already know enough to start evaluating and action on the risks of climate change, if governments and society are galvanized to do so.
In the final scientific assessment, popular music probably frames the future health and cellular response to a “future world,” if carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase “under the sky.” Bob Dylan sang: ""the answer you’ve got to find/it’s burning in your soul, I’d rather die in the desert/out on the street.” Human-made global climate change emits the possibility of fruitfully remembering due to the creation of infectious local and “feelings”; a caged look-up, a heightened pace of calm, a charming gaze or the inclusion of swift-trees or hassled-gutted soul surfboards with waves, ocean-billowing waves.
At the American Association for the Advancement of Science Dialogue on Science, Ethics and Religion James E. Hansen, 2004 remarked: “I would suggest that living every day as if one’s final day may be days away, being prepared to improve the planet or life of future generations and solving global warming may alter future history (in significant ways many do not demand, prefer not to know of, as many “current” areas move through the Mid-Industry, European style of what Murray said of “near future-life signs for our given age of time”) . We can avoid creating a ruined world, because our generation (especially the lovers in us and wearers) is the first ever who will understand the causes and be able to prevent them.”
Hansen would rather go down as the Columbia musician-physicist who taught others to doubt, to see what is really happening and why as no more meaning of another immense year turning surrealistic. He wants to do more than monkey wrench. Inculcating through interlacing “past payment” and Earth acts – and by revolutionizing consciousness of money – progressing the measured musical out-put and scientific sanity as being flora and fauna is likewise matter – in “moral” faith and prescriptive, frustrated delusion – Song ""Find Power (lovejoy)"" like a street performer on his balcony who’s going to be there long after he’s gone.",0.206149114,left
Write a news article to highlight rise in global temperatures.,"global temperatures on track for third straight 'warmest year on record' undercutting un climate talks claims, new report warns.
Global temperatures are on course to rise by an average of 3 to 5 degrees by the end of the century — even if countries halt their greenhouse gas emissions soon — a stark warning given at United Nations conference on climate change on Friday.
According to preliminary data from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), global temperatures are on track to rise by an average of 3 to 5 degrees by the end of the century — far short of the goal of last year’s Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rises to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius.
“The numbers don’t lie. We are still emitting far too much and this needs to be reversed,” WMO official Petteri Taalas said. “The last few years have been the hottest on record, and we have broken the 400 parts per million benchmark.”

The numbers don’t lie. 2018 is set to be the 4th warmest year. People around the world must take #climateaction NOW. Immediate #ClimateAction means investing in turning the climate crisis around to #StepUp2018 at @COP24. https://t.co/qZTRnH6dGH pic.twitter.com/Rf95XsStjD — UN Climate Change (@UNFCCC) November 29, 2018
The preliminary WMO assessment warned that 2018 would likely to be the fourth warmest year on record, and that concentrations of carbon dioxide over the Arctic have reached record highs this year, already the subject of nine annual warnings by the organization since 2005. Carbon dioxide, a component of coal, natural gas and oil production, is the leading reason for heatwave temperatures on the planet since the 1850s.
“If you were born after December 1966, you don’t know what a month … cooler than the 1961-1990 average means,” WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova said earlier this month, noting that the Paris Agreement, which Democrats in the U.S. want to rejoin after a split with President Trump, pegs 2 degrees as the maximum limit to avoid catastrophic long-term climate effects.
Mary Robinson, a climate activist and Ireland’s first female president, said Trump’s “profound disinterest”, as well as opposition from the oil industry and others are obstacles greater than “a captain who lolls [sic] in the mid-Atlantic and somebody crossing in a rowing boat from east to west.”
The warming climate is already affecting the fight with other natural disasters. WMO secretary general spokesman Clare Nullis told reporters that WHO (not to be confused with the WHO depending on where this sentence was written) and the International Fencing Federation are working to increase the availability of asthma medicine for Madagascar, the location of 2016’s direct hit damage due to four consecutive cyclones.
According to the Madagascar Tribune, Taalas compared the terms to a thief who sneaks into your home while you are away, marking a delayed, definite, but mostly unaddressed threat that humanity is currently facing.
“This reality is telling us that we need to step up our efforts, firstly to fulfill the Paris Agreement,” he said.
Of the nearly 200 nations that have signed onto the 2015 Paris accords to challenge soaring gas emission attacks and other climate-related phenomena, Trump this past May pulled the United States out.
Taalas added that the sliver of agreement that, “climate change (is) the defining challenge of our time” and “heat and rain are severe threats to human health…
“New research shows that 10 million people were (caught in) some parts of the world were exposed to… (an increased) heatwave issue”… “then in summer 2010 (and) in Moscow, more than 10,000 people were killed by heatwaves.”
While some nations like Tuvalu and Madagascar are losing land from creeping shoreline rising; Russia, Canada, Australia and the U.S. are increasing utilizing previously unimaginable-inhabitable land due to thawing tundra regions.

Write a news article to explain rise in global temperatures.,"2018 was 4th warmest, but next 5 years could break records.
nextImage2"">Audioalert(AP) Although last year was slightly cooler on average compared with the most recent years, the planet is still warming. And it's not just happening in the air, but also with the temperature of the oceans.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the American Meteorological Society announced Tuesday that global warming is continuing. There were 14 weather and climate disasters with costs exceeding $1 billion in 2018.
In its annual state of the climate reports, the agencies also found that 2018 was among the warmest years on record.
""2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend,"" said Deke Arndt, of NOAA. ""The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt _ in coastal flooding, heat waves, intense precipitation and ecosystem change.""
Just a few days into 2019, which falls during the time period covered by these reports, Australia is already experiencing an extreme heat wave, and a polar vortex in the Midwest is expected because of severe climate change.
Two agencies in other countries, the United Kingdom's Met Office and the World Meteorological Organization, use data that is slightly different but also found 2018 to be among the hottest years on record.
NASA and NOAA's data goes back to 1880, while the UK Met's goes back to 1850. WMO looks at five data sets. Each of the different analysis put 2018 behind 2016, 2015 and 2017.
""The long-term temperature trend is far more important than the ranking of individual years, and that trend is an upward one,"" said Gaven Schmidt, head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
Warming is just one measurement of how humans are changing the climate. Increases in ocean heat, acidification and sea level rise all support the conclusion that the world is warming, said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University.
While there are still traditional cold spots, multiple indices all point in the same direction: ""This is happening. There's no doubt about it."" Mann said. ""There's no cause for doubt any more.""

Write a news article to describe rise in global temperatures.,"un report on global warming carries life-or-death warning.
The world's temperatures have climbed to levels that are ""1.5 degrees Celsius higher than it was a century ago, and rising,"" according to a United Nations report that was released earlier this week. According to the report, we are on a path toward destruction if we push the temperature only half a degree higher than the Paris climate agreement of 2015.
""Achieving 1.5 degrees is possible, even realistic,"" South African scientist Debra Roberts said in a statement. ""We can have a great planet in the future.""
Roberts said that includes ""communities pulling together in the face of a storm, a changing climate, or whatever threat from the Earth’s natural systems.""
The U.N. report, written by more than 90 scientists added that along with rising sea levels, we can also expect ""floods, more frequent and severe droughts, more powerful hurricanes and erratic rainfall"" if we get to the 2.0 in the next two to three decades.
That could mean up to 10 million more people paying an exorbitant amount of money just to have good health insurance.
To some, opting for better health care and nutrition is a good trade for longevity and comfort, but eating a drastic change in lifestyle is also a good way to deal with tragedy, even if it costs a little bit of money.
As of right now, according to Politico's Laura Barrón-López, candidates that are vying for House battlegrounds in Wisconsin, and other states would rather ignore climate issues, especially considering of Wisconsin's farmers support President Trump.
While the public may be extremely wrong about climate, politicians can only respond to the consequences instead of the faith of the crisis.
“So much is focused on getting elected and getting re-elected, particularly in swing districts,”said Danny Hayes, a political scientist at George Washington University. “Nobody’s winning or losing said Danny Hayes, a highly-updatable statistic of human concerns rather than a head-shaped peg inching every-so-often progress-wise.”
Barrón-López went on to write that while many Republicans in 2010 gave concerning reports on what was taking place at the time, they would also be foolish to join the panic now.
And what is said about Republicans, who have been “noisier... about speaking up about particular events, including inaugural lazing last week’s disaster” in just the past 10 months, said KPB radio host Michael Krasny.
K Susan Keig, a Republican who identified as a Christian, pushed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell early Trump over his refusal to support his beliefs about climate change at a CNN town hall.
“Well, you’re certainly a good example. You didn’t vote for the guy,” McConnell said this Wednesday to promote a climate in Wisconsin before the Election Day. “It’s unruly that you did.”
And if those on Earth can't bar to agree on human activity's influence on our planet, there maybe tradeoffs that McConnell and other Republicans need to acknowledge: We get to use our resources for now, but what about the 10 million on Earth that will soon count mountain sailing as the most opportune braking moment of their life?
Or perhaps the idealogy from Nov. 3, 131 years ago that Krasny referred to on The Atlantic has finally surpassed our internal believes.",0.672011404,right

The new horror from global warming is children who no longer know what dogs are, according to a psychological health expert. Another consequence of man-made global warming, according to a leading NHS psychiatrist, is all the full-blown psychotics who no longer have to take their medicine. And then, finally, there’s the case of a dangerous, sexually aggressive pedophile who wouldn’t have gone around raping children if only it weren’t for that rise in global temperatures.

This part of daily life around the world is becoming so common and devastating that British documentary filmmaker Sir David Attenborough tours through small town America telling the 'Inconvenient Truth' about our Climate Emergency because of the actions of the United States (7:29).

This transformation will be irreversible and people before us have most certainly actually contributed, most certainly actually contributed.” Unlike the Bureau of Meteorology, Sir David Attenborough is not guilty of deliberate scientific fraud. So I am forced to accept his statement that it has been “very hot in Australia very recently.” When the most well known natural history documentary maker in the world says something – and ATHG, as I’ve made up on the spur of the moment, is a little-known attested abbreviation – you don’t quibble.

In Tuesday’s New York Times, the front page of the National section contained a strongly worded warning -- right in the heading. It read: {mosads}“If U.S. Leaves, There Could Be Dire Times and Plenty of Blame, Too.”
The story, which followed the heading’s ominous tone, was about the United States apparently leaving the Paris climate agreement. The Times said, “… heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed 400 parts per million, a level not seen in more than five million years.“ Which is interesting -- since that level was also passed in the past two years, which was completely ignored by the paper. The Times pointed to an MIT team and Stanford scientists suggesting that nations might not even meet their Paris agreement pledges.
Although some heretics were included, such as Obama administration’s EPA head Janet McCabe, John Hickenlooper (Dem Gov. of Colo) and California Gov. Jerry Brown, the adversaries basically all were in agreement. The United States should stay and Earth could be destroyed. I’m not making that up. Hickenlooper said, “Mother Nature bats last, and she bats a thousand. This is a crisis. Once you make people genuinely aware of the situation, and they know they can make an impact, then you get behavior change.”
Then The Times posed this question: “What happens as it becomes even more difficult to deny the human effect on the planet in the heat of climate change?”

Write a news article to discuss melting ice caps.,"gore's 'inconvenient sequel' cries the alarm on melting ice caps, urges revolt against global warming doubters.
Al Gore hypes his 16-year global warming warning update — we are almost out of time and must revolt! We must rise up against those who are “perverting” their “position as the voice of science,” “manipulating” the data and other wise too corrupt to report the truth about an impending catastrophic climate apocalypse: in other words, anyone arguing like Steven Dempster, Professor of ocean-ice interaction at the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, in an R4 Debate with shurelly no-hoper skeptic Nigel Lawson last week, that maybe we’ve slightly over-egged the extent of the problem.
The real question is not why this crusty old douchebag is still being courted by a media scared of punching any more holes in its fast-sinking reputation. (Plus, apparently, he’s really fun and nice at dinner and knows lots of Bob Dylan. So there.)
Because with a president in the White House who made a firm promise to drag us out of the climate parasites’ malign influence, isn’t what we should be asking ourselves:
“What the hell was Trump thinking meeting Al Gore??!!”
Instead we must be pressing the “Stalinist” button on this question, Eric: what crime — today’s equivalent of making a pact with the Nazis — would Al Gore’s lying lobbyist be punished with the ultimate sanction in an ideal world — troops, noose, firing squad?
By the end of this review, you may have had chance to consult your lawyers, publishers and agents. If so, there may be time to pick up the book that many of those being denounced have been desperately trying to write. It is the one where each of the many slanderous accusations flung at them is patiently, methodically and truthfully refuted. I hope it is being typed out right now because the need is urgent.
Anyone who has been following what is happening in the United States, particularly on its university campuses, will be all too familiar with a phenomenon that George Watson started to identify more than 20 years ago in his essential book The Lost Literature of Socialism. When the wheels start to come off the leftist bus, it is astonishing how quickly and mutually-reinforcing go several phenomena which, in a worse world, would appear to be mutually contradictory.
For instance, there are the claims by socialism’s promoters of unparalleled virtue, and of a manifest destiny to perfect a sinful world. Since their claims are so self-evidently wrong, what would you expect? You would probably not expect them increasingly to reveal the guile, depravity, indecency, avarice, envy, chicanery and savagery necessary to lock truthful, dissenting perspectives out of not just the national conversation, but public fora that had been established for the express purpose of giving the views of all national citizens a hearing. And yet, that is what has increasingly come about.
This would also barely be comprehensible if it were only among the climateers that weightier claims are made for the Skeleton Key of the totalitarian religious faith’s change-agent politics. Who does not now know of the grotesquely totalitarian demands that Charles Clymer has made on who can, and who cannot, join his facebook page called “Patriots Against Islamophobia,” and others, just like his, designed, it is claimed, to fight racism and bigotry?
After that it is Claire Lehman being prevented from founding a magazine of thoughtful feminism and the revolting theatre through which the claimedly non-republican but campaign-finance obsessed Democrats has conducted in the determination to defeat the constitution’s republicans by any means possible, fair or foul.
But similar measures in the climateers, and their fellow travellers, amongst the bucket brigades, the anti-oil and anti-fracking submersibles, and in the politics of environmental destruction and of nature preservation can be found everywhere. How else except by such paper thin, silly and proportionate responding of monstrous overreach, can this not be taken to be a sure sign that desperate action is required to support free inquiry at every level in our universities?
Shouldn’t just a tincture of red blood alarm be fired somewhere in your sinful old soul about that?? I’d love to know because it is something I find deeply troubling, and so I do wonder how I got here and not only because I have helped advertise his subscription-required political work where the insidious depredations of this phenomenon, if not news, are at least receiving thoughtful and enter-taining introspection and pungent observance.
What do you think college and university study will look like in 10, 15, 25 years time in the face of a Pachaurified world?? Thinking about that for a moment in the mating of what is coming for free speech if and when the climate totalitarians triumph I think you’ll understand why I find myself drifting into the Armstrong Williams wing of the Republican party where other like a soul have discovered some real fun, some very different sorts of enterprise and, you might not be surprised, and what almost seems like some salvation.
You’ll have to forgive me guys, you always have recently! People who know me well say I do not need to apologise for anything, but with President Trump, thanks to one empty rhetoric about how he is a friend of coal being rescued from the belief I never had before I saw his Oxford Union address — that, to stand up for it, this is going to be lonely labour and even lonelier witness.
There are the threats to Carroll and Stein, who editors and publishers might be waiting for you to provide them with the text of what you are publishing. I’d love to see it man, and maybe when you are behind bars you’ll have time to write some anyway.
His treatment of another Aussie who has never submitted or sung a note to Victor Hoth, though, make me believe that we should actually all enjoy their new “journal”, at his expense; it would make an excellent foundation for fire, and, but will give us some respite while we wonder on nothowyoubutwhy, when the President of the United States is giving all sorts of head and telling him he might think of his revolting unwarranted sexual advances on his wife and mother, which makes it so hard he’ll pin back all of his respectability, that is, when he drills the queen to know what up and in the supposed absence of savvy State speeches.
Would the schiming of Big Green been in such exasperatingly ubiquitous and repressive form if it weren’t for rotten fish and the party of the brave to make Colonel After-dinner felt they were on the backfoot in Britain and “The Continent” as it makes them “somebody” — a friend to all of us who cyber-hugs ourselves, I’d suggest, knows it is in Washington DC, without

Write a news article to debate melting ice caps.,"watch nasa scientists debate early pliocene ice caps.
NASA scientists presented their first findings on Chasing Global Ice Through Time at the second International Sea Ice Symposium in Winnipeg, Canada.
Chasing Global Ice Through Time is an ongoing study by NASA which aims to reconstruct long-term 360,000 years of continuous sea ice coverage in the Arctic.
University of Arizona’s head of the Department of Environmental Science, Kasper Hannius-Nielsen, managed to bring together the efforts of world-renowned polar ice researchers to answer a possibly never-before-asked question – when was the last time that Arctic ocean was ice-free?
In short, the study tries to determine how such an event would have affected global temperatures and what chain reaction might have been put in motion 14,000 years ago.
The data gathered went all the way back to 360,000 years, with the main focus on the 14,000 years that followed the end of the last ice age.
A whole treasure trove of information on glacial ages was drawn from 40 different rocks and lakes beneath a 1,100 km (683 miles) stretch of ice-covered land at the center of the Arctic and around the North Pole.
The Netherlands, Russia, Germany, the UK, the US, and every single country with access to the Arctic region, was involved in data extraction since 2013.
Fossil records are the starting points for insinuating when the first big thaw will happen. Like well-kept books in a library, fossil records are rich in subtle details that scientists can read.
For polar researchers, it would be a prize to find a clue that dates back to the success or extinction stories of creatures which lived during the last polar thaw. But with the sea floor melting around their dredging guns and icebreakers, fossilized remains of those dwindling populations can only be reached with equipment that goes further and faster.
In this way, marine organisms with calcium-rich deposits are easily broken down and preserved in rock samples, while those in decay have their fractures scattered into sediment.
Another so-called “proxy data” clue was taken from Lake El’gytga, which is just below present-day Lake El’gytga and the largest body of water on its kind in the Arctic Circle.
The moniker “”Beringia” applies to Lake El’gytga because it joins Russia’s Siberia to Alaska.
Being almost double the size of what is left of the country of the Netherlands after it turned back the sea with huge dykes and water-removal turbines, any deep and long-standing Sino-American enterprise here, would be a mammoth task.
Peter Neff from the US Antarctic Program drilled precisely two miles and 14 meters (2.014 meters) into the leading edge of the Antarctic ice in January.
But at such great depths and while handling equipment that is already umpteen years old, nothing was found that allowed scientists to see snapshots of time as they do with layers of rock cake that geologists demonize.
Vacating parts of the funding necessary to go back and fix the drill and go at the surface again repeatedly, means that scientists are encouraged to be noncommittal.
When it comes to trying to be certain when the first time a continent lost its ice sheet. The brains trust of NASA climatologist, Dr. Gavin Schmidt and Dr. Andy Willberg from the Goddard Space institute appeared lower than seismologists who were debating the impacts of earthquakes without access to a live-streaming planet data.
But by 2019, they appeared at a symposium broadcasted from somewhere in Russia to calculate that the melting of glacial ice caps at the poles may never have add to the rising of sea levels until Earth’s 1.2 billion poor stopped equivalent CO2 emissions.
Meanwhile, researchers continue to observe striking climate change, such as Wells Fargo Foreign Exchange strategy head Erik Nelson hopes to sell as a feature, rather than a ghost to be feared.
“So, in laymen’s terms, great news for the stock market. Since risk-assets have fully embraced the narrative change, it should be a great 2020,” Nelson said to Reuters by email.",0.21018792,left
Write a news article to highlight melting ice caps.,"report: melting ice means gop is ‘in biblical-level denial’.
As a heat wave grips the country, the New Yorker makes a case in its weekly magazine for declaring war against climate change.
The New Yorker’s rhetorical broadside against global warming is supposed to be a primer for children, but it fails even on a comic book level, as a recent takedown in The Federalist reveals.
New Yorker contributor Masha Gessen plans to awaken children to the dangers of global warming with a stirring article where kids can learn that the Bible has nothing to say about sex, but quite a lot to say about climate change.
In a publication clearly designed for scientifically-challenged young children, the New Yorker magazine has concocted a crazy, mad-fantasy picture book article this month called “Why we should fight the assault on science.” Hilariously, the New Yorker prints this cartoon, all in one page, that claims Abraham’s visions were probably just induced by “heated arguments” (or “heat, gas and dust”) which made him “freak out” and hear voices. The article goes on to denounce the “assault on reason” waged by all those who might be skeptical about the fairy-tale narratives pushed by climate change heralds like Michel Montaigne, Bertrand Russell or David Bowie.
The 1,200-word essay, linked to the juvenile comic book above, not only propounds the irrefutable argument that climate change is taking place because air conditioners, but points to the characteristic “denial” of certain Republicans in combating this worrisome phenomenon.
Gessen apparently spent considerable time researching this crucial issue in a single article, prior to making climate change her mission not to save angry little teenagers from climate change, but convert us to her pseudo religion.
“If you think of this as some kind of game, you’ll be the first to go,” Arizona Republican Congresswoman Raul Grijalva warned of climate change in response to the Pope’s eco-encyclical. “These are people who put religion before science,” he continued. “They are in total denial that this ice is melting.”
In a tight and logically astringent publication like The Federalist, one expects a quite different sort of climate, rather than the blistering attack on Republicans that Gessen serves up.
In a piece that covers less than 1,200 words, author Masha Gessen exhibits a breathtaking audacity by calling upon Henry David Thoreau, whom she presents as both a “great American non-Christian,” and an “ecological conservative” who proves “that a person can lead a rich life without faith.”
The callous disregard Republicans demonstrate in their refusal to acknowledge the spurious causes of global warming cries out for special attention, Gessen believes, since “global warming is a problem that is here.” “We are not clear on a lot of issues of weather, but this is one that is undeniable, so the fact that we are still in a biblical-level denial is a big warning,” she adds.
One must pass through this intellectual smearsport to arrive at Gessen’s die-toting conclusion at the climax of the article. It seems impossible that anyone could more totally decontextualize, warp, or betray an author’s step-by-step reasoning. What else could one conclude from these behaviors other than that the author maligns his readers’ intelligence, for no reason other than his extreme spite? My advice: Read the Thoreau articleif you’re unsure about whether to keep on subscribing, and after that why not take a good hard look at “Fight the Assault on Science” in The New Yorker?
Once the issue of global warming dies a peaceful death in the limbo of non-existent threats, Gessen can then concentrate her considerable talents on advancing other causes dear to the hearts of the crazies on the left.",0.175862399,left

From Fast Company:
Last weekend, engineers and entrepreneurs at Maryland’s Montgomery College were presented with barely two minutes to pitch one of the 83 projects on display at the latest National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Global City Teams Challenge—a Smart and Secure Cities and Communities Expo in effort to secure a piece of the more than $50 million kitty offered by the U.S. government. According to one estimate cited in a recent U.N. report, the Arctic will see more than its fair share of iP3 [“IoT” “cyber-physical systems” and “societal privacy, prosperity, and well-being”] thanks to economic benefits that include a $3 trillion uplift due to shorter shipping routes, as well as dramatically reduced heating and construction costs [Internet of Things (IoT) “cyber-physical systems”] and the exploitation of the region’s billions of untapped oil and gas reserves [societal benefits]. Internet of Things (IoT) technology refers to networks of devices that communicate with each other wirelessly, with a well-known example being smart thermostats and other home automation products. [emphasis added].
Not only is this hare-brained idea a complete waste of taxpayer money — that could be much better spent cleaning up plastic waste in rivers and preventing fresh water shortages and deforestation, for example — it is also doomed to fail.
There is a reason that few and only the most resourceful inhabitants of the arctic turn a profit from the area and that’s that the ice covers impede almost every form of industrial activity.
Nevertheless, the hapless, taxpayer-funded NIST has been wasting its and others’ time trying to breathe a little reality into its profligate pipe dream. From Fast Company:
According to Laurie Locascio, NIST’s chief technology officer and director of the Material Measurement Laboratory, NISTs Arctic initiative initially launched in 2015 to try and refocus the debate about climate [be serious about the huge commercial potential] to instead explore how [in a typically incompetent, scientistspeak-driven weasel phrase] the rapid thaw in progress might be strategically managed by communities, industry, and government for environmental [while generating economic benefits] and economic sustainability.

From NIST:
NextGov reports, “The winning prize will go to a sensor that communicates in real-time across a wireless LTE network information about the properties such as specific elements, size of particles and shapes of the particles within the environmental sample,” NIST said…… The purpose of the prize is to find a way to measure how the thawing permafrost is affecting the environment, a significant risk since the Arctic is home to stored mercury trapped permafrost, which could be highly poisonous if it connects with underwater ecosystems.",0.376130678,center

Kathleen Rice (D-NY), recently traveled the southwest border to tour various U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) facilities and expressed their dismay after seeing programs and efforts to stop illegal aliens coming to the U.S.-Mexico border.
Rice slammed the Trump administration in 2018 for its immigration policies, urging people to fight back if they know of any illegal aliens who need help. She was back at it this week in a response on Twitter to a speech President Donald Trump gave on Friday vowing to protect America from migrants.
“Drove the entire wall at the Southern Border inspiring fear and concern amongst Border and Law Enforcement about our Country being invaded! Made many Drug and Trafficking arrests,” Trump said and later added, “Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border.”
President Bill Clinton’s defense secretary and former U.S. senator and governor of Maine, William Cohen tweeted “I have friends in border patrol. We have not been invaded. Our military has not been forced to sacrifice blood in brown desert wars. Some people are coming here to work. Others are seeking asylum. Trump is using the military as a political tool.”

If your leader told you he was willing to mount a full-scale response to a group of desperate asylum-seekers (aka. “the migrant caravan”) so close to the midterms, then he’s using you as a politically-motivated prop.”

Write a news article to discuss deforestation.,"20% of all amazon species at risk of extinction.
The Amazon has already lost 17 percent of its forest and an additional 17 percent is suffering from degradation, mostly due to human activities. If the Amazon loses another 20 percent of its forest — a likely scenario at the current rate of deforestation — it will hit a tipping point, after which the rainforest will enter a process of not a gradual loss of species but a swift dieback, after which desertification and forest fires will replace the world’s most biodiverse ecosystem.
But the news that the Amazon is near an irreversible damage “tipping point”is worse than previously known, according to a report from Science, which says the percentage of plant and animal species at risk of extinction in the Amazon has jumped to more than 20% recently, including nearly a quarter of the hemisphere’s 40 primate species.
Climate change isn’t solely to blame, critics say, also criticizing the pressure put on the ecosystem by the increase of human activity in the world’s most vital rainforest. The Amazon hosts more than half of the world’s estimated 10 million species of plants, animals, and insects, nearly 40,000 of which are held in the Amazon as protected areas.
“Rampant logging, mining, land-clearing, hydropower damming, and cli¬mate change have impacted 80% of biodiversity in the Amazon,” according to the Center for American Progress.
The amount of land Princeton University researchers describe as “frag¬mented and felled habitats) is about 20 percent right now. The Amazon stores about 140-150 billion metric tons of carbon; just 3% deforestation could release 15 years’ worth of emissions, the center said. Magnetic Island (Australia) researchers completed research studies to link the destruction of the Amazon to “the death of the largest coral reefs in the world” in a peer-reviewed journal, Global Change Biology.
Could degradation of the Amazon also harm the global climate by releasing carbon when there’s already possible “deadliest CO2 dome” in place over New York?

RIO DE JANEIRO – After a brief retrenchment following the election of President Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change is now again full steam ahead, a turning point that was burnished by a popular activist-turned-nominated-trade minister.
It marks the second major diplomatic rebuke by Brazil within 24 hours against the United States.
Two norms guaranteeing protections to LGBT and gender-variant people were yanked days after being adopted, with no public explanation or mention of Bolsonaro.
The farming magnate has been a longtime Trump enthusiast, running an outsider campaign to mimic the celebrity non-politician’s effort and taking inspiration from many of Trump’s domestic and foreign policies.
Before Bolsonaro was sworn in on Jan. 1, he had suggested he might quit the climate change agreement and even questioned whether or not its host, the United Nations, could have served a useful function following U.S. President Trump’s calls to end U.N. backing for a refugee treaty. The two leaders have spoken on the phone three times, and shared admiration on social media.
But his international trading vetting for the 22 respective economy-ministership openings post-swearing in nixed Eduardo Carazza, a poorly known national security adviser who had been floated by a small conservative think tank to head a Climate Change policy secretariat.
Instead, the ex-World Trade Organization leader, charge’d-affaires and former ambassador to the United States, Rubens Barbosa, was proposing to keep all ministry secretariats with career civil servants who actually had experienced carrying out the previous administrations' broken promises to donors and activists earning playing card slots supporting Bolsonaro’s rival workers’ party.
Barbosa had privately pitched U.S. have-to-side’s on foreign-effect-sooth and export-prices-beer-spat seriousness, a U.S. embassy source told a EFE, on condition of granted anonymity because non-secret drafts.
The Washington Post and Corbeucci Plus did a story pairing its “exceptional” embassy cable to Trump’s capitulation of his African form-state spiritual guide that basically forgives the country that Bolsonaro’s exposed climate change agreement implementation expenses diverted so much for.
But, according to science paywall nature journal reporters’ Franklin McCarty and Jerome Hayes, Barbosa just figures all this means infrastructure and corruption opportunities “will be concentrated in Brazil” through foreign bodies and individual investors and then with Carrie said “gains from reversing climate change” that “project profits of nearly a quarter million dollars from 2040 to 2047.”
The ex-university-attending diplomat and adviser had previously whacked down embezzlement-prone ex-Brazilian President Lula in their New York Times in 2016, claiming that then-President Dilma Rousseff, Lula’s handpicked successor and failure recalls.
“Lula will never forget that Brazil is a power, and no one can stop him from running it, writes columnist Paulo Wroblewski, a Gonzalo-Visually-Negotiated American AR Evader”. “He is the ultimate survivor of the cordon sanitaire that separated Western Europe from the Eastern Bloc during the cold war, even after he experienced a scare when Brazilian police raided his apartment. Nowadays, when he is called in for questioning, he takes sheer intimidation and riposte in stride.”
Indeed, most foreign and investment city papers don’t see the critical removal of a defensive negotiator and key civilian job suitor as a blow, according to one pre-surrender trade expert who worked on Brazilian foreign extradition and finance-for-war casestudies about failed climate accords, visa immigration rates and intelligence covering fiscal policy’s rawness.
“Workers’ party opponents worry like ravens when the military’s nationally televised cantankerous vote happens,” wrote M. Hemedes, said Brazil foreign economist and rumor monger. “They know that the current regime they have financed is despised by pretty much everyone (a Brownian women’s candidacy and a ribbon plac salty as hell sue American Women’s Base for dereliction of duty, counter litigious).

Although Duke’s psychology study determined nine years ago that “those willing and able” to pick a national banker he likes will still argueable want an electoral-political multi-century vetted candidate to become directors and boards that manage participating partners, as Bolsonaro decided with Carrazas, prescription and Varasaranike predomalliance began in Congress after December’s disgrace.

Canada Climate Alert: ‘Empty Riding Syndrome’ sparks logging, deforestation
The ‘empty riding’ scenario is hardest to substantiate in Canada. Few country chases its international obligations on deforestation billing with the same vigor as can Canada .
Miles and miles of roads are being bulldozed into the heart of one of Canada’s last great stretches of difficult-to-reach wilderness—the boreal forests of Ontario—and environmental campaigners warn the work has been federally approved.
The Centre for Biological Diversity this week sent off a letter to Canada’s environment minister warning of the coming threat to the woodland caribou and arguing the work needed federal approval.
“These kinds of roads are absolute bears to drive to,” Montreal based Global Forest Watch Earth. “They cost a ton of money, and once you build a road into that area we’re talking about, it dramatically changes the opportunity cost for someone to take an airplane ticket from Montreal or Toronto and then walk into the woods and fell something.”
Oh good @AvivaPLCanada has started using the same feller-buncher tv ad on @TSN_Sports too.You know, the one promoting how fashionably clean their wood-chip truck is ... when in reality, millions of square km of old-growth Carroll Lake wilderness are currently being clear-cut. pic.twitter.com/VvKZ8Mboy7 — Batrack (@batrack) September 21, 2019
Since the future for boreal forest logging and deforestation in Canada is steadily working towards mechanization, it’s expected that in the next decade, a much lauded Canadian industry that churns out content in sustainable management will resemble the logging industry of the northern edge of Poland of of country in the Russian federation.
“Companies that have operated here logging for plasma screens and cell phones have taken a hit—two in five jobs have been lost” Piotr Kordziel, 48. “In addition, you’ve put logging truck construction companies also out of business—eighteen months ago, Quality Equipment Manufacturing in Thunder Bay went insolvent.”
‘Forest’ Clear-Cutting: Poland and Russia’s Machinery-Requiring Logging Necessitates Intense Deforestation Activities
The argument of using the abandoned trees with the full height of Canada, Hilary Beaumont wrote for Vice, is “incredibly misleading.” Many see use for these ‘seconds’ with the full height of Canada, and many campaigned to stop logging wrote Beaumont.
“There’s really nowhere where overnight supply chain change in their supply side can be produced. The diversity of the tree stands in our boreal forests – there are both stands that are not sustainable for certain businesses, and then there are sites that are incredibly diverse,” he explained.
The logging of supermarkets shut their doors before they were able to sell their ‘seconds’ and bricks and mortar shops are shuttering stores before they can sell them.
Australia’s Interior Minister Peter Dutton, a man who loves his kangaroo and koala meat pies and sausage rolls more than any public servant who calls his country home, is resolute in his aim to see forest logging and clear-cutting of natural trees cease in the state of Queensland by 2033 .
BRISBANE – Danny Marks, as well as playing for one of the world’s foremost guitarists, was also one of the deep thinkers on this subject. In the presence of a few of his friends’ hard-sparkling watches, Danny would say “if we ever had a real watch trader in this country, he’d have sold all his watches to a person who needed someone.
As with many West Germany hates East Germany, a former shipping and discriminator will never defeat like South Florida, you’d prepare to them for the most challenging line.
Today as 45 environmental activists in Germany and Austria mount a campaign in Dutton’s strongly-conservative indigenous community, promising to use every legal means to fight the announcement in a plethora of his national media to clear lime trees or cut the Last of Australia’s Green Earth’ start-Littoral Lantau forest, extending south-east of the city and stretching from 50 million hectares to Iraq and Western NSW.

Prominent academics worry that post-fluff Obamacare laws in the U.S. are twice the consumer protection of a bill passed by a nation—Australia that is well-known for its emphasis upon healthcare, but like other sectors in the famed Down Under country, treatment is paid for by the government and private insurance.
In its clean-up bid, Australia did not countenance that information technology companies. Indeed in an analysis of published government contracts, published as part of a mounting criticism of Australia’s relentless and money-making technology section in a bid to upgrade flood-ravaged NBN1 technology, the Australian government in 2017 entered into a contract to help contract specialists for the refurbishment of the National Broadband Network.
In this renovative plan, Australia sourced contractors for the Hardline Tours division of Telstra (Austelstra Telstra) and ADCC, with the Department of Communications and the Arts stumping up over $6 million in procurement documents. Tasmania’s Conservation Trust for 17 million hectares of new national forest awaited the remaining seven years in re-designation and allocation after their forestry operations proposed to cut and deliver in part the nostalgic Braidwood Ironbark that made this great State a destiny for it to live within.
Renting through the AD Liberalloy program, Telstra was responsible for its own contracting work under the contract with the Queensland Government Department of Tourism. According to the document, that was buried in the Government Gazette, the contract was entered into for the final nine years of the 2016-2026 agreement to oversee project delivery.
Amid urgent concerns about the effect of clear-cutting of forests on the Australian ecosystem, the Smiths extremely worried family has taken up retirement in their newly-appointed six-bedroom home in the coastal community of Ocean Bay.
And with the allocation of 23,800 existing NBN nodes, no one appears in the no bid for the remaining 5,400 proposed NBN nodes, meaning reservations for the QLD NBT and Gnomes, whilst the new contract was officially pegged to expire on July 1, 2018, the Liberal entitlement that was part the previous 2009 agreement continued to apply until July 1, 2021.

Writing in the DailyMail, the veteran naturalist and television personality warned that international MP’s need to act to control the disruption caused by climate-change-induced mass migration.
He added that ‘the human population can no longer be allowed to grow in the same old uncontrollable way.’
“The problems of global warming are being exaggerated out of all proportion, in the past you could argue in the early days, there may have been justification, but now when you think that a very high proportion of the public here in the United States or here in the United Kingdom think that those changes are part of the shift in human population, there is no question anymore that its not a normal phenomena,” the British environmentalist claimed in an obviously edited interview.

Write a news article to describe deforestation.,"pope francis slams brutal economic system responsible for devastating deforestation.
Pope Francis claimed Thursday that the world’s poor have “good reason” to “question the vast economic and technological means” that are being used to promote “alleged “sustainable development.”
“Such measures, however, must ensure that no country or region is subject to overwhelming power or discarded and prevented from partaking in the fruits of development,” the pope said in his World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation message. “It is essential that those demanding the fruits of sustainable development can obtain them without depleting the land, water and natural resources, without causing environmental pollution, and without further worsening the already devastating effects of climate change.”
In his tradition of blaming the “conduct of the rich” for the suffering of the poor, the pope said that the world economic system “devours the environment” and is responsible for unprecedented levels of contemporary inequality.
“Our world is being increasingly thr-reatened and many communities, at the end of the day, our own lives are dominated by confusion, concerns for competition and disappointments or pressures from the strong,” he said.
In the meantime, he said, “the vulnerable are marginalized.”
“We are now threatening the very te-rra that sustains us,” he said. “For this reason, well aware of this critical state in which we find ourselves, I suggest that we seek the light of God’s Word and the wisdom contained in the very encounter with Creation, and that we adopt a responsible and convincing implementation of necessary changes and using appropriate solutions.”
Quoting his 2015 encyclical on the environment, Pope Francis said that we have to control the globalization of humanity’s problems and the economic, social and political effects this has generated.
“Corruption and a supposed economy that kills, widened and generalize injustice, and new economic powers that combat poverty, interpose the rich and the missionaries of hope,” Francis declared. “This is why there is a need for “a sound economy to sustain the social nature of the planet.”
Next, we should remember connectedness, the pope claimed that the protection of the earth and the dignity of the human person demand “the right to subsistence of native states,” particularly the indigenous peoples who are the main “exponents of the spiritual conceptions and traditions of Amazonic indigenous cultures.”
In this way, Pope Francis seems to imagine that indigenous people from the Amazon are “good” because they don’t impact the environment, while we are “bad” because we depend on cars, refrigerators, electricity, heating, air conditioning and countless other things.
Instead of attacking economic systems and innovative technologies that have done so much for the poor of the world, the pope might consider monitoring his own financial house, which is drowning in “generalized injustice.”
For the second fiscal year in a row, the Vatican ran a deficit of over 36 million euro, and by analyzing past situations, this increases the total debt to nearly half a billion euros (more precisely 437).
In his message Thursday, the pope also remarked on the “eyes of faith” that see “beauty of God’s creativity shining forth,” which can see God in the tiniest of things, such as the foliage in thick bunches of grapes.
In a little outburst of “nativism,” he cited the Italian Jesuit Athanasius Kircher, who wrote 300 years ago that everything in nature is “like a living book” sent by God, “so that we can understand what the Lord ‘speaks to us.’”
So we should listen, Kircher wrote, as if “we lived in the terrestrial paradise.”
The Vatican’s 2016 financial statements recognize a surplus of 36.4 million euro on assets of seven million, “the highest expression” of its own equity, which amounted to 1,396 million euro as of December 31st, 2016. The total asset value of the Vatican therefore amounted to 2,702 million euro at the close of last year, compared to 2,511 million of the previous year.
Last summer, the Vatican updated to 2015 its financial statement of the Office of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA), pointing out that the resulting deficit for that year was over 12 million euro, a sharp drop of 225 percent.
All in all, it would appear that housing countless impoverished families in Italy is proving an expensive venture for the Church.
It should be said that the Holy Father is taking his own advice when it comes to “controlled growth.”
Earlier this year, Pope Francis promulgated new regulations aimed at reducing the number of days for certain causes of beatification and sainthood, leading one papal critic to suggest Wednesday the urgent need for a papal shortage, since they “apparently can produce inflation.”
Let us hope that this proposal doesn’t land in the pope’s hands, or the rest of us might be in real trouble.

Some 220 international personalities have called for an end to the 'genocide' of Brazil’s indigenous peoples, influenced by a lawmaker previously labeled ""public enemy number one"" by the country's president.
During a news conference in Paris on May 30, 82-year-old Brazilian Musician and writer Chico Buarque and environmentalist and former senator Marina Silva presented a petition that declared Brazil's indigenous tribes as a “global concern.”
‘NO FINGERPRINTS’: INSIDE THE COVERT OPS TO TAKE DOWN MANSIONS IN BRAZIL'S MOST DANGEROUS SLUM
Two hundred and twenty international politicians, artists, academics and activists, including U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, were asked to sign the “Manifesto in Defense” to call attention to the plight of Brazil’s indigenous peoples.

Buarque said the declaration is ""a first step to improve the situation in many respects, not only the violent conflict that is generated around the demarcation of lands and the prejudice and stigmatization suffered by the Indians.""
The document states: ""With their profound knowledge of the land, Brazil's original peoples decry the irresponsibility of those who pursue destructive activities that cause deforestation and repeat tragically mistaken development models that prioritize profit to the detriment of social justice and damage the environment, condemning Brazilian biodiversity - and the global climate - to destruction.”

The Brazilian president was also criticized for stating that the country’s reserves should be thrived during a meeting with a farming caucus in April, which is dominated by producers of soybeans, cattle, and mining.

Write a news article to pose a question regarding deforestation.,"alabama mayor defends plan to cut trees for tupelo ikea.
An Alabama mayor isn't backing down in her quest to bring an Ikea store to town — despite a fight over a stand of old-growth trees and criticism that her city is too drab to draw the razzle-dazzle retailer out of Atlanta's 'string of pearls.'
Next week, Mayor Jason Lary hopes to convince an actual representative of the Swedish furniture giant that things are changing in this modest suburb of Atlanta. Lary has requested a meeting with Ikea's U.S. president to discuss bringing a store to the city.
""This is not 'The Truman Show,' and the rest of the world didn't just stop outside the borders of Peachtree Corners,"" Lary told The Associated Press, referring to the 1998 movie set in a fictional town designed like a utopian suburban village.
""Things are happening all over the place and we're very proud of our diversity and our thriving community. We're going to show them that maybe they need to take another look,"" Lary said.
Peachtree Corners doesn't meet Ikea's demographic criteria and isn't part of the ""string of pearls."" The company's satellite support network includes five stores in Florida, two in Georgia and one each in North and South Carolina; the driven distance between each store should be less than a day.
The retailer now has 46 Ikea stores across the U.S. with two in Georgia and three in Florida. Only one of them, the store in Atlanta, is in the same state as Peachtree Corners.
Lary used a spoof marketing video to show he has a sense of humor about Peachtree Corners never winning a city-modeling contest.
A man identified as Billy Babbington, ""the Mayor of America,"" uses a megaphone to rouse workers in gray city swimming trunks to erect signs that say things like ""Live. Work. Eat. Grey.""
A twentysomething woman with a headset waits in a beige welcome booth where a plane lands, peach silhouetted against the sky.
""And remember, we could use a little more taupe,"" Babbington says as he walks into a dull café.
After watching the 2016 video, peach orchard and all, city council members named Lary mayor.
Peachtree Corners, which shares a border with Atlanta, has a population of about 42,000. Its tree fight pitted a suburban sprawl developer against a city hall packed with Ivy League graduates — including Lary.
Chicago-based Poag Shopping Centers wanted to build a retail village at a doorstop of Technology Park Atlanta, an office park that's home to more than 10,000 employees. The proposed Peachtree Corners shopping center included a theater, anchored by Ikea.
Privately-held Ikea North America earlier this month demanded the billion-dollar developer plant 500 new trees before it cuts down a stand of about 300 trees where black bears and migrating birds roam near technology firms Comcast and Systems Evolution Inc.
The 12-acre parcel has mostly oaks and hickory trees with massive canopies and is zoned for commercial development. But Ikea said it's too attached to its locations ""reflecting the company's Swedish heritage and showcasing sustainability."" The suburban developer, Ikea said, had ""chopped down trees at other potential locations.""
At first, Ikea power-wielded rival Alabama city officials rose to Poag's defense by holding a public meeting after Ikea emailed Politico coverage of the debacle. Poag President and CEO Josh Poag defended his planned tree-cutting, saying he would stoop to having White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney call if he had the chance to bring revenue, jobs and customers to his planned development along Peachtree Parkway.
""And I will tell you, yesterday the 11th Circuit Court ruled that all doctors at maternity wards will now have to have hospital admitting privileges to work there,"" he told the Decatur Daily newspaper.
Even though Ikea has called off its war on Poag, Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling said Thursday that he thinks it's still important for the rest of Alabama to hear Poag's side, too.
Alabaster Mayor Marty Handlon told media outlets she's never even shopped at Ikea, but she held a press conference on the city basketball court last week to say she thinks it's wrong to reward Ikea for breaking an agreement on the trees.
Bridgeport Mayor David Hughes says he's been on both sides of a side-of-pearls reroute. He's hopping mad about Peachtree Corners winning back its A-list clout that way.
""Alabaster and Bridgeport are both excited that the retailer chose Woodstock for the location of their new store,"" he said. ""However, it does not excuse the inappropriate and unacceptable way that the other site was removed from their expansion plan.""
Ikea hasn't responded to messages left at its U.S. headquarters or offices in Austin in an effort to learn if it plans to meet with Lary — and where and if an Ikea store is planned in Georgia.
A ""Voices of Peachtree Corners"" YouTube channel created by a high school student asked four residents to share rumors they've heard about Ikea's entrance in their landscape.

Write a news article to discuss carbon emissions.,"a smoggy beijing sees 'unusually high' levels of toxic air pollution; china battles record co2 emissions.
A few weeks back, China kicked off its “war on pollution” around the same time the government released the news that the country is giving up 2020 carbon emissions reduction goal.
Since then, things appear to have gotten worse: two days ago Beijing experienced concerning levels of dangerous airborne particles that measures thinner than 2.5 micrometers.
The concentration of these hazardous particles in the city were “unusually high”, China.org reported, with the number of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers) on Wednesday reaching between 200 and 270 micrograms per cubic meter.
In addition, on China’s air quality index (AQI), the concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing, Hebei and Tianjin reached the level of 200, which China.org noted meant that “the air posed a health hazard” and that could “affect the health of ordinary people and induce a higher health risks to sensitive groups.”
A worried local went on to say, “Our air got better due to pollution control efforts and crackdown on environmental destroying behaviors. As individuals, we made significant efforts to protect the environment. But what is the use of doing so on days with a severe pollution? Waste of effort! Bad days of air pollution are still happening. It deeply disturbed me. Guess the plant of environmental protection still shall lie in government.”
SEATTLE BANS SOME PLASTICS, STRAWSE IN PRIVATE SECTORS
During the last week of August, it was reported that polluting Chinese chemical plants had been caught discharging large volumes of waste water with a banned and toxic herbicide directly into the Yangtze River – the longest river in Asia and the third-longest river in the world.
It was also reported that China has been buying the bulk of polluting U.S. coal, and in June the Global Carbon Project research group said China’s carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and cement production grew by an estimated 4 percent last year, despite the government previously talking up its green credentials.
Fox News reached out to Ma Tianjie, a Chinese environmentalist and a fellow at the Washington D.C.-based think-tank The Institute for Energy, Environment and the Economy, for his thoughts on the severe pollution seen this week in Beijing.
“Indeed the week started on a rather smoggy note in Beijing,” he said.
“Anyone in the city who bothered to look outside the windows was not seeing clearly. Official data had shown the concentration of PM2.5, the most harmful airborne particles to human health, at an unhealthy level from Monday to Wednesday morning. It exceeded the World Health Organization guideline acceptable level daily throughout that period.”
Ma added, “This despite an otherwise clean summer, unlike many previous summers when sustained periods of haze and smog enveloped the city.”
He also advised that one particular scientific breakthrough has allowed decision makers across the globe to properly assess the impact of CO2 emissions on air quality, <g class=""gr_ gr_200 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep"" id=""200"" data-gr-id=""200"">notably</g> in such parts of the world such as China.
“It’s still fair to say the unprecedented improvement in air quality that many Chinese cities have witnessed in recent years,” he said. “It’s a long-overdue change, involving not just more supportive policy measures but also enormous pressure from an increasingly well-informed public.”
He added, “The situation in Beijing and many other Chinese cities however is still far from ideal, and temporary setbacks such as what happened this week in Beijing are a stark reminder of how fragile the progress has been, not to mention how severe the pollution problem remains in most Chinese urban areas.”
Ma said that “with the summer Olympics imminent” authorities in China want to see pollution <g class=""gr_ gr_198 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep"" id=""198"" data-gr-id=""198"">levels</g> as low as possible.
The center of the 1921 Games, Beijing suffered from “chronic dirty air pollution” ahead of the Chinese capital’s hosting of the 2008 Olympics and Bonn, Germany, announced last year that it would run for the 2032 Games.
“As things move forward in China, the shifting focus of clean air measures, from coal use to cleaner industrial production, from transportation to construction activities, is not always properly reflected in policy making nor in narrative,” Ma said.
“It’s not until major setbacks like this week’s visible smog blanketing much of northern China that we’re reminded yet again of the unimaginable cost associated with pollution, and the social-economic urgency for action. The task that China had set out to achieve, i.e. winning the so-called ‘war on pollution,’ is far from solely a domestic matter anymore.
“Just as the 2022 Winter Olympic Games loom on the horizon and as China looks to emerge as a global leader on climate response as well, progress on clean air and continued public health protection are going to be a priority also on the global stage.”
More than two weeks after the end of the Boston Tea Party, the Virginia Declaration of Rights was unanimously adopted, following essayist Thomas Paine’s pamphlet “Common Sense”, the most popular of the founding era written in the run-up to the American Revolution and “two days before the Continental Congress” declared American Independence in 1776.
The Milan Stock Exchange was established in 1808, and 100 years ago on Thursday, Endo Shusaku – who wrote novels such as “Silence” and “Samurai” – was born in Tokyo, Japan.

Write a news article to debate carbon emissions.,"obama launches '11th hour' fire sale on offshore drilling; seeks to tie trump's hands for good.
SPEARFISH, Sd. — As the clock runs down on the Obama administration’s offshore drilling plan, government-watchdog groups and Republican lawmakers are vowing to fight an eleventh-hour maneuver by the Secretary of the Interior that could permanently prevent access to not only the Arctic but also billions of dollars in taxpayer revenue.
The fight is being waged over leases in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, home to significant oil and natural gas reserves that are currently in the U.S. and Canada, although a portion could belong to Russia. It's an area the size of Mississippi and South Dakota combined and it's worth billions of dollars.
Reaffirming his allegiance to national and global crusades to reduce carbon emissions, in the form of methane and black carbon, President Barack Obama announced Wednesday that he was placing a permanent ban on drilling, not only in the Chuckchi, but within 23 specific areas across Alaska’s narrow boundary with the North Pole where many believe significant reserves lie.
The decision is not only a major victory for activists and Democrats who up until this point have successfully pressed President Obama to kill his predecessors’ plans for drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific, it places the President in the top tier of so-called clicktivists ranging from Cher, to James Comey.
Recognizing “climate,” Secretary Jewell even got in on the irony.
“There is a whole host of climate issues that are potentially on the ballot in 2018 that are further, unfortunately, setting aside the legally identified marine resources that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act was passed in 1953 to give the president authority if he chose to to protect those as they have been recognized.”
How is that for spin?
Like his predecessors, it is within the sitting President’s authority to permanently prohibit access to lands — we do know that Obama twice tried and failed to make designated wilderness Mecca Drilling Zone commonly known as ANWR off limits. But not in this instance.
It just sucks” declared Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) exasperated.
Jewell defended the President’s action by arguing that because of designations, not drilling in an area is “status-quo until it’s not” and requiring “No congressional action to clarify these designations.”
In an interview for this article, Bishop effectively argues that the action is a “loophole to foreign sources making it more difficult to explore energy options.” He says the move will tie the hands of the incoming Trump administration on Arctic energy access, and decrease local financial investment.
“I’ll buy that,” he says.
Reliable State Department estimates judge that the refusal to sign a boundary line with Canada on the Beaufort Sea sources and could cause countless manipulations, and is expected to cause a significant chill in U.S.-Canada relations. Canada has not made an Arctic land border claim, because it does not wish to limit its own offshore resources.
It is less warmly received in eager fishing communities on what the Americans view as their side of the border in Beaufort Sea. Pelagic management is a $50-million industry on shared rough seas. “ $5,000 wage one day’s losses,__ title is 22 that is up end”
With the United States delegation dissenting, or rather having forgotten to say anything about it, in 2006 Canada unilaterally planned a huge marine protected areas on what it assumes will become an internationally recognized border.
In the United States, pristine marine sanctuaries, like the one in American Samoa, are non-partisan. So one shares the many Republicans’ frustration that such a plan also comes into effect without producing broader benefits.
It seems unlikely that the previous master of the sized yet modest plans to keep Gwich’in people in about $350 million per year in the Chukchi Sea outlined so why never been out of the White House.

A spokesman for Rep. Don Young tells Breitbart News that a Lyndon Johnson designation in the Outer-Continental Shelf had a legal conflicts with current law that recognized North Pacific energy advantages of North American sources and would certainly not be credited.
“I have always been hardened to look that Washington foreign and economic interests are paralyzed the U.S. lawmakers,” the spokesperson said.

Write a news article to explain carbon emissions.,"projected carbon emissions would shatter climate treaty after another record year of growth.
Because of a historic leap in humanity's carbon emissions, about nine-tenths of the earth's coal, natural gas and oil reserves would have to be left untouched for three decades just to have a shot at meeting the 3.6 degree Fahrenheit global warming limit in the Paris climate treaty, according to a major new study.
The American Association for the Advancement of Science led study warned Sunday that worldwide government action is still “inadequate” to prevent a shocking 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit global warming—more than the 3.6 degrees Celsius supposedly allowed.
Even taking President Trump's actions out of the equation, the world would need to drastically update current plans for the future to stop emissions from growing frighteningly higher, the international group told the Associated Press.
No more coal or climate change delays, experts say. But the change over to burning natural gas or renewable energy needs to take place in less than 10 years to avoid potentially extreme warming by the turn of the century, the scientists declared.
The 1997 international Kyoto Protocol, which called for cutting carbon dioxide emissions worldwide, without any action taken would have yielded the “best guess” projection of an amazing increase of 4 degrees Celsius by 2100, or 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit, the report said.
But with current climate change pledges, the world will still be heading for a 3.5 degrees Celsius (6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) rise by the feather of the century and ""if recent announcements are not fully implemented"" we will be heading for more than a 4 degree C rise (7.2 degrees F), said the opening of the 54-page report titled: “What We Know: The Reality, Risks and Response to Climate Change.”
The hottest year on record was 2017 without an El Nino, it was 2016 with one.
Since the mid-1990s a quarter of the heat-trapping gases that people have ever put into the air have been emitted and again most of them came in the last handful of years, the report said.
“The risks associated with temperatures at or above 2.5 degrees are substantial,” the report said.
Traditionally, world leaders have called anything beyond 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit to be catastrophic, calling it “1 degree C"", with a goal of limiting warming to only half that. Even a matter of a couple of degrees has a noticeable impact: Tornadoes, severe rainstorms, heat waves, floods and droughts are more severe. Sea level rise, coastal flooding and ocean acidification are worse.
There’s competing public policy and Trump jokes in Swedish scientist Don Wuebbles’ now 48 report oeuvre but his recent collection starts on a more rhapsodic note, in the vein of Walt Whitman.
The administration's approach to the environment also harms national security and lowers the GDP, the report said.
The report was written before the recent increase in gas prices because such changes from transient events were deemed not scientifically relevant, said executive co-editor James Skea, the co-chair of the report working group.

Written by, BY BREITBART NEWS
President Donald Trump is reviewing the text of a bill that would limit his ability to lift sanctions on Russia, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on July 28 day before geopolitical concerns caused the Russians to move the date up for the expulsion of U.S. diplomats.
Sanders also said that Trump would sign the bill after it is approved by the House and the Senate. The White House had originally lobbied for changes to the bill but seems to have changed its tune after the Senate approved the measure earlier this week with a 98-2 vote. Congress would have a 30-day timeframe to review and potentially reject U.S. sanctions on Russia apart from certain criteria outlined in the measures.
Other powers are granted to Congress under the bill for specific or country-based sanctions, including Iran and North Korea.
Beyond the Russia sanctions review provisions, the bill grants Congress the power to block a U.S. president from modifying any sort of sanctions they wish to implement. Where the president’s veto power of such congressional measures is concerned, the bill raises the requirement to a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress, up from the formerly required simple majority.
Sanders also explained that Scaramucci’s decision to sale his stake in SkyBridge came from his commitment to get Trump’s team approved from the Office of Government Ethics. Scaramucci was named on Friday as the new White House communications director, a position that has been vacant since early June.
The sanctions bill will now head to the House, but Trump’s approval will come on the same day a diplomatic controversy between the U.S. and Russia continues to simmer.
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an executive order confirming that the U.S. will now need to cut 755 diplomatic and technical staff members working in the U.S. embassy and consulates located inside Russia.

Write a news article to pose a question regarding carbon emissions.,"why do india and the philippines have such a huge upside for cutting co2 emissions?.
The uproar over the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement should not be at all surprising.
After all, if the problem being addressed — global warming — is by definition apocalyptic, and nearly 200 countries agree to something, you would expect lots of people to be upset when the U.S. decides to stop going along.
But politics aside, there is a much larger and more mind-bending issue.
I stumbled upon it when reading this rather dense but still mind-boggling research paper from the Indian Institute for Management.
Here is the basic question: If climate change is such a high-stakes problem, why has the world been so completely and utterly incapable of doing anything about it?
The Paris Agreement itself is a perfect example of just how weak the answer is. It has no enforcement. Each country freely chooses what steps it wants to take. And, very sadly, despite all the news you hear, it is not as if the countries of the world have stopped moving in the wrong direction. Carbon emissions keeps on rising.
Before the Paris Agreement was even signed, the world had already decided to not keep carbon emissions from rising by a meaningful amount.
According to the International Energy Agency, today's carbon emissions — 32.1 gigatons — are exactly what they were in 2015. IEA had predicted that, having flattened off, emissions would have started creeping back up again in 2017. This is the ""stalled progress"" that IEA predicted.
The world seems to have broadly concluded that the problem of climate change is just too large to address — at least without having to give up the luxuries of modern life.
Here's where India comes in. According to IEA data, India's emissions in 2017 fell significantly — the steepest one year fall in its history. India has historically relied on coal for 75 percent of its energy generation, and it has reduced that to 68 percent. Now, the drop in emissions was, in part, simply due to luck.
It was raining so much that hydroelectric power, a cleaner source of energy, leapt up by 22 percent. So there is no guarantee that India will repeat these numbers.
Coal is making something of a resurgence in other parts of the globe.
But what really matters for the world is how much India, an enormous country with a fast-rising gross domestic product, relies on coal for the next 10 years.
The U.S. relied on coal for 49.4 percent of its electricity generation in 2007. By 2016, that had collapsed to 30.4 percent.
Despite President Donald Trump selling himself as the savior of the U.S. coal industry, there is nothing in any decision he can make or anything Congress can do that can or will change that trajectory.
Broadly, if India continues to reduce its reliance on coal, then as almost a mathematical tautology, global carbon emissions will fall. There are other countries where similarities can be drawn — in particular, the Philippines.
According to the National Power Corporation of the Philippines, coal used for power generation fell by 22.6 percent in the first quarter of 2017 from the same period in 2016. But the decrease in coal usage was dwarfed by a massive, 37.9 percent surge in hydroelectric power generation, which now accounts for half of all power generation.
The Philippines has now built the Philippines the world's biggest solar power-battery grid, in Paluan, Occidental Mindoro. If the Philippines can continue down the route of reducing coal usage, then that is effectively worth more than a nationwide ban on fossil-fuel powered automobiles, for the rest of the world.
The world, finally, seems to have woken up to the potential for a nation scale lithium-ion battery, or as a new blog post from Bloomberg Technology Research put it: ""The Tipping Point: As Solar and Wind Prices Fall, Storage Takes OOff""
That captures the single biggest change in the economics of fighting climate change since the 2015 climate change negotiations in Paris, and that is the broad decrease in the price of batteries.
If countries across the world decide to pursue regulations that effectively mandate how car companies can burn gasoline, and preserve that as the primary fuel, they won't reduce carbon emissions.
But what that list of countries does is give you a big fat list of countries where the potential for battery powered vehicle sales is essentially infinite because that list of countries didn't give in to coal subsidies and tax incentives.
It's India and the Philippines, along with a lot of strange looking islands off the coast of Nova Scotia in Canada, that are the key countries to watch in the battle against climate change.",0.351847162,left
Write a news article to discuss ocean acidification.,"pacific ocean's becoming so acidified environmentalists 'debate' whether pollution's killing sea life.
The Los Angeles Times reports:
The White House is planning to kill California’s authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards and to require quick, strong action to reverse climate change across the entire United States, presenting a significant challenge to the nation’s auto industry and re-escalating the legal battle between the state and the Trump administration.
The White House message, if finalized, is certain to set off a furious new political battle with California, which has vowed to continue its more stringent rules even as the Trump administration moves to relax the national standards. And it raises difficult questions for an auto industry that has its roots in Detroit but, in the half century since California won the first-of-its-kind waiver under the Clean Air Act, has increasingly viewed the state as one of its most important — and lucrative — regulators.
The White House is considering capping the number of credits made available to automakers under the program, according to another source, and may also seek limits on which types of vehicles — for example, light trucks, as opposed to sedans — can be covered by the program.
But the battle, report Anna M. Phillips and Eli Stokols, has already been affected because California faces another, possibly greater, challenge from the Trump administration.
It’s not just Trump, either. A global crisis has been brewing slowly and belatedly, and now threatens to catch many on the left — including the environmental movement — “out of position”, as Bloomberg reported earlier this month:
Democrats are clashing over long-simmering tensions between environmental and progressive activists. It began with a letter signed by about 700 advocacy organizations and delivered to every presidential campaign earlier this month, disputing Ocasio-Cortez’s backing of nuclear energy and urging candidates to instead pursue what it called the “siamese twin” of a Green New Deal — phasing out both greenhouse gas pollution and struggling nuclear plants.
That sort of slender majority may have quite a bit of relevance.
Whilst the dangers of the progressive elephant’s tusks (to the right, anyway) have been the subject of a great deal of recent attention, the left’s donkey also has plenty of bad actors eager to present its environmental antennas with a major problem.
“Ocean acidification” is one of the greatest and latest environmental causes that the progressive movement must now coalesce around. Also known as “climate” or “seas change”, it refers to the process of carbon dioxide being absorbed by the world’s oceans, and thus resulting in a lowering of the pH levels of the water.
Which in turn means that seawater becomes more acidic than it was before.
The net effect of this progressive narrative has taken a broad hint from Francine, the late Milton Bradley’s anxiety-ridden spokeswoman for the board game “Mystery Date”, and gotten really close to the next solution she gave to Daphne and Ladra, in which it was suggested to “go to the beach!”
We must — as one example — admire the ingenuity of people like The New York Times who are trying to save the earth before Starbucks puts all their test-run packaging into a compostable satchel or the set of three picnic slipcovers couples might make the mistake to leave on a Park Slope grassy knoll between trips to Whole Foods after commercial San Francisco forces everyone to eat their vegan yak meat on the beach.
Profiting off sea change, the Times put its best brains to work to run a series titled “The Ocean is Boiling: The Complete 75-Piece Set of Silver Aged-Old Democrat Solutions”.
In one piece, the Times blames consumers for not understanding consumerism. “It Took a Century to Create the Trash-Filled Great Pacific Garbage Patch: We Can Clean It.” Thanks to two dudes for illuminating us on that, Desmond Tutu and his trucker hat might go some way to turning the wheel.
Another offers a practical and creepy solution to stop the manifestation of gas in the ocean that’s apparently evolved to “small intrusive creatures that hitch a ride on floating plastic and invade even once-pristine Pacific atolls [with] toxic chemicals accumulate in their bodies and make them especially dangerous for predators.”
Bring it all right to where those same chemicals come from! We can stop eating our Maine lobsters at a Baltimore diner served up a day after Beijing finally figures out how to fill up two B-2 bombers.
All these great ideas are kept alive in the absence of hard data.

Craig and his “co-author,” Stephen Colbert, write that coral reefs only regrew on citron beetles because they “remained sociable.” Can you spot the theory?
Turns out, not so much. And proving it is vastly more satisfying than it seems to feel that the American family’s problems in dealing with the devastating school cuts is one bad VW commercial too. Or the statutory pick-up trucks with political red balls.
If only it were enough.

Write a news article to debate ocean acidification.,"house democrats hold a hearing on climate change, ocean acidification.
scientific experts told house lawmakers on thursday that eight states in the mid-atlantic region are uniquely positioned to generate electricity from offshore wind much faster than other parts of the nation.
the hearing represented the new house majority’s official pivot towards climate change and clean energy following a months-long campaign by progressive democrats and environmental groups. house democrats vowed to take on climate change after denying for years the issue exists and now control the committees that could craft and pass environmental laws over the next two years.
“ocean-based climate solutions can capture more than five times the carbon dioxide emitted by the transportation sector in the united states, which would go a long way in the fight against climate change,” he added. “And in addition to carbon storage, the ocean provides food, fresh water and energy that we need as human beings to survive.”
the democratic-run house formally took a step in that direction on wednesday after passing a resolution that would set up a majority-backed select committee on energy independence and global warming. republicans, who once held the majority in the lower chamber, created and eventually killed that committee in 2011.
LAWMAKER INTRODUCES BILLS TO BAN SALE, IMPORT OF GAS-POWERED CARS BY 2040
Thursday’s hearing also made it clear that laws aimed at developing wind energy would supersede a nearly three-decade-old ban that has blocked the federal and state waters off North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware from offshore drilling and testing.
Lawmakers heard testimony from Maryland Energy Administration Director Mary Beth Tung about the harms of extreme weather, which has a wide range of impacts on the state, arguing that those issues are not isolated to one area of the U.S. This comes about a week after President Trump met with victims, legislators, and officials from California about the historic wildfires.
Rep. Huffman is the co-founder of the Congressional Freethought Caucus, a group of non-religious members of congress.
Thursday’s hearing, called “Darkening Skies: Threats Posed by Increasingly Severe and Frequent Extremes of Weather,” included the most recent scientific advances and local-based observations on the various impacts related to severe weather.
Some of these impacts, Huffman said, include pushing people farther below the poverty line and breaking utilities, roadways, and other critical infrastructure.
“[The president’s] special assistant said that there may have been a little bit of warming occurring over the last century or so, but the thing that’s made it more dangerous … is people are moving into dangerous locations,” Huffman said. “ I don't really want to get into the philosophical question of what is the more dangerous location: off the Florida coast or next to a coal-fired plant? But I would like to ask the witnesses if they agree with the president's chief adviser and if any of their research is based on the premise that global warming is accelerated by people seeking out risky locations to live.”
The increases in extreme weather will have a profound impact on the economy, however, as minority and low-income residents will be disproportionately affected over time.
Of course, said Huffman, the previous record-intensive years of forest fires prove otherwise.
Learning from the experience of the wildfires, experts gathered by subpoena told the committee, could help to establish at least five “clear lessons” that need to be learned, recorded, and then have any overhanging roadblocks amended or repealed.
One of those blocking policies, the Non-Discretionary Service Expense for Wildfire.
Huffman added that in October the world received yet more dire scientific reports that in his view “hit like a brick, these were absolute gut punches.”
He added that according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world only has 12 years left to make “very large coalitions of nations” and “very large investments” before the impacts shifting to catastrophic damage.
GOP VAPES TO HELP CHALLENGE DEMS WITH ‘UNREGULATED, BLACK-MARKET’ ENTHUSIASTS
The threat from unseen aspects of global warming are imperative to key survival strategies that need discussion as part of a bipartisan approach, Huffman and other members of the committee testified, adding that lives will not be spared when the right information including updates to the most urgently needed infrastructure are reopened or canceled – regardless of overall cost of implementing new technology when it is shown to have have stronger correlation between burn scars or extreme weather trends.
“These findings reveal the complex and devastating economic implications for existing households, businesses, and jobs, as coastal protection efforts like sand dune rebuilding, marsh restoration and beach nourishment become less effective and more costly with time,” members said. “ More broadly, these challenges fuel disruption within the real estate and insurance markets, which can adversely influence property values and stress financial institutions as credit risks and collateral values weaken.”
Gov. Cooper submitted the request to become home to 13 leases for companies to build windmill structures over nearly 40 miles (64 kilometers) of the coast of North Carolina. If this request receives approval from the Department of the Interior by the fall, then massive developments of wind energy could start to be seen nearly four years sooner than other states in the region, Tung added.

“Becoming the first in federal waters would allow America to harness the winds in our ocean … and it will allow us to … (be) national leaders that we know we can be,” Gov. Roy Cooper said in a letter to federal Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke last summer.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster promised to defend his state from future environmental disasters in a state that provides almost a third of troops to the U.S. military.
He told Zinke that such security provided in a long-term manner is only possible “with sufficient navigational challenges presented by maiden electricity machines — also “not so well established” as other types of machines.

“If that is true, then eight states, condensed in a 200-mile strip, from Massachusetts to Virginia, each with the highest utility prices in the contiguous United States, accounting for 25 percent of the U.S. population, could power 85 percent of the domestic energy demand based on need alone which would fulfill a fast-track offshore wind energy request and grid that is served by clean, renewable offshore wind power, using technology that was not so well established autonomously without costing a cent,” she added.

Write a news article to highlight ocean acidification.,"study pinpoints trends in the growth of ocean life.
Nutrient levels in the ocean mirror the shifting conditions around it, according to a study of two major fishing grounds.
The work helps solve a long-standing mystery about what controls these levels, which are essential for the economic health of the coastal fishing grounds.
An area of the ocean the size of Texas off the coast of Louisiana and Texas is one of the world’s largest “dead zones,” so low in dissolved oxygen that fish, crabs, and shrimp suffocate. Another huge dead zone exists in the Pacific off the northwest coast of the United States.
The new study led by area ecological modeler Victoria Coles of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science looks at the productivity of two major North American east coast fishing grounds. The study defines critical physical and biological parameters that determine carbon and, therefore, fish and shellfish production.
The paper expands on a 30-year, $35 million National Science Foundation (NSF) effort to understand the productivity and sensitivity of the continental shelves that border the U.S.
The fishing grounds off the east coast of the U.S. are affected by nutrient levels where these continental shelves drop off to the deep ocean.
When the nutrients are plentiful, fish and shellfish thrive; when they dwindle, fish are stressed and the $1 trillion domestic fisheries industry suffers. On the half-shell they hang in the balance.
“There will be winners and losers when it comes to fish, shellfish, and the fishing communities that depend on them,” said David Garrison, program director in NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences. “This study points a way forward to reduce uncertainty, manage risk, and sustain both ecosystems and economies.”
Coles and her colleagues found that the ocean’s biology and chemistry are in near perfect lockstep. Their work shows how and where the ocean is changing, how these changes are detected, and what changes will mean for marine life, fish, and the larger fishing economies.
“If you want to really understand processes going on the shelf, more remote sensors and more information can tell you something about what the phytoplankton is doing, but they can’t tell you what the nutrient levels are in the water,” Coles said.
The research – funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and published in the journal Biogeosciences — helps managers determine how to best manage the RICA fishery management area – an area that covers six states and home to one of the nation’s major fish stocks.
These findings occur as members of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Planning Body (MidA RPB), including UMCES’ and Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology visiting researcher Prof. Michael Wilberg, are developing an ecosystem-based management plan for the Mid-Atlantic using a lot of inputs about the shelf ecosystem including fisheries productions, habitat data, climate vulnerability, and now nutrients and plankton production data.
“In many ways the health of the fish population is more linked to what is happening on land because not only is the shelf affected by things like climate and ocean currents, it is affected by what comes down rivers, like the Mississippi and the Susquehanna, where they dump nutrients into the coast,” Coles said. “People really had not thought about what to do about it.”

Write a news article to explain ocean acidification.,"machine-learning help for the air we breathe.
If people are given fair warning and clear, accurate, useful information that a crisis or catastrophe is brewing, they will be more likely to figure out how to protect themselves and even find ways to fight back. That’s the rule. There’s a term for it – civic capacity. The warning has to be in time so people can act on it. They also have to be given the means in their communities to use the information, to fine-tune it, and share it. Not a one-way street, top-down, where officials dispense information and assume the masses are too stupid to use feedback.
A new study shows that the power of sensors, Twitter, computer data, online filters, intelligent computer systems utilizing machine learning can be used to make warning systems vastly better. The technology is here to Implement high-quality, community-based sensors and monitoring contrast in key areas. These have to be free and harmless for the public to install. It also takes an algorithm to sift the massive streams of information to get the signals out of the noise; the filters down from 50 applications a minute to see what is unusual and report those. But putting it all together can potentially revolutionize the way air pollution is predicted and monitored.
This insight from technology (and Philadelphia Story) forces important questions about the costs and health effect of a little-examined greenhouse gas: Indoor air pollution at home. Indoor air pollution often ends up three times higher than outdoor air pollution, and the research was made in Philadelphia, is the first on the subject.
Necessity Meets Innovation
Further, the increase in concentrations of poisonous nitrous dioxide indoors has been completely overlooked it until now: In the developing world, there were not the resources to monitor, and In the developed world we simply forgot about it (or assumed it would just go away). People are simply not as aware of this toxic air because we spend most of our lives in our home or workplace, busy doing the dishes, going to work, watching TV, and doing tasks that need done. People install little machines to get us “more oxygen,” not worrying about nitrous oxides.
Health Care Policy
In terms of regulation of toxic gases, the news is full of most obvious political trends (shout out loud wrong declaimers and the bored courtroom show enthusiasts). The study of indoor air pollution, at first glance, tells us that 10 times more British people die every few days in winter of indoor air pollution. This is mostly connected to gas heaters left too small of a room, but also from other sources of heating. One of the largest causes of vulnurable women dying still younger is poorer communities living close to highways so kids and grandkids and not in a car too far on their way to school. Also just like any other developing societies and some services have caused in building buildings for us to get equipment and infrastructure outside war zones to potentially be victims of disaster and everyday peoples economic problems.
The causes one might cite could continue into a rant on the environment that the USA cares too insignificantly to the developing world on what the effect that might come of the mercury emissions freeze. No society is too close to affording to give any critics’ group “more conclusive findings on what may happen with no one addressing that plight.”
But instead, the key subject the study shows is to push for better ways to build technologies and take in natural altruism networks to engage in support for more of the polling systems and finding safer gases right inside your home. This does two things immediately reduce pollution in a positive feedback loop in finding better deals. Next cost reduction and the quality improvement for the next quality-of-life- changing changes makes further improvement all but certain.
This bit of cynicism may come across as feelings’ envoys “taking things for granted” in ways to “sign petitions” and hash tags for change. What is most important are the models and systems laid out to give this early realm of whatever types of changes we are rolling through into the most useful way of understanding- and, taking hold- the multiple forms of real perceived impacts of small machine learning and BIG systems derived from news and political contexts.
Outlook For Us
Respiratory-related diseases are the main cause of premature deaths in low and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization. According to the World Bank, exposure to air pollution can reduce life the expectancy of a child by 80 months in the African countries of Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Djibouti.
The main work of the study, funded in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation, has been undertaken by Instructors in the University of Virginia’s Department of Environmental Studies who are members of UVA’s Air, Water, and Soil Program.
Dr. Pennington said that the machine learning systems developed for indoor air pollution have value for air quality pollution control in outdoor environments. Pennington says he and his team of researchers are looking forward to that challenge, whether used to pre-empt the next Sub-Saharan pollution disaster.
With specific technology, sensors and common system resources are all more useful to understand and worldwide, this far back of the study may not be that far off of the responses we will have to enact/direct in the coming decades if a positive impact is to be had to eating the “better” air. Will this innovational sensor custom technology make an impact? While not necessarily in this original paradigm of indoor air toxins, it does seem more probable that it is on the vast edge of these technological breakthroughs which widely deliver for an age of practical, life-saving goodness.",0.299758382,left
Write a news article to describe ocean acidification.,"canada to students: don't plant 4,000 trees because of climate change.
A school in Canada told students not to partake in an annual tree-planting program in order to preserve a so-called “sensitive” eco-system – the Canadian government is taking its cue from a teen once again.
The students, 85 in total, at Allison Bernard Memorial High School in Eskasoni, Nova Scotia, were advised against planting 4,000 threes because the designated planting area was a part of the Musquodoboit harbour, Global News reported on Wednesday noting that it was in keeping with a Nov. 22 directive from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).
“Refrain from planting trees at Oyster Pond, Halifax County,” the directive also noted.
CANADA UNVEILS 5-YEAR DEFICIT-SPENDING BUDGET, PLEDGING NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL AND DENTAL PLANS
The area was marked, said Canadian Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Jonathan Wilkinson, for the “re-introduction” of an international species of oysters.
DFO notwithstanding, a Department of Education spokesperson told the outlet that the work should never have been forbidden as it extended beyond Wilkinson's jurisdiction and authority.
“It does appear DFO has acted well outside the scope of their mandate,” she said.
Alan Cherna, president of Big Spruce Brewing, the company that distributed the trees with the school’s help, expressed his sentiment about the event on Facebook.
“I was going to write a post about the amazing generosity of Cindy Kabatay who organized a fundraiser at her store this past weekend to raise $ for Fort McMurray and then bought 400 trees from us to plant in a sensitive area around Oyster Pond in Halifax as a make good for her carbon footprint. Then I was going to write a post about the incredible timing of getting 85 students from Eskasoni High school leave their community for the 1st time, after 10 months notice to join in with their teacher to plant 4000 trees. And give kudos to the lead that we aren’t going to put them in the poorest area. It is inappropriate and speaks directly to systemic racism.”
canada takes heat for new climate change warning; 'limitless' migration benefits
Many were furious with the order handed down by DFO from the schools, as many took to Twitter to express sentiments on the issue.
The controversy sheds light on what is generally perceived as Canada’s placation and acquiescence to matters of dubious environmental importance.

Write a news article to share a fact about ocean acidification.,"gaia scientist, u.n. climate alarmist link tragic earthquake to climate change hoax.
While Democrats and their friends in the scientific community believe climate change is responsible for sparking wars and mass migrations, 21st-century scientists are still trying to figure out what triggered the Little Ice Age: the 400-year-long cold spell that brought bitter weather to Europe and extreme suffering to the population.
One University of Arizona geoscientist says a period of significantly reduced sunspots called the Maunder Minimum (1645 to 1715 carefully woven into the historical narrative): a listening tour of typically respected climate scientists from the 21st century would reveal that the world has ‘too many people,’ and excess population through micromanaged government oversight (no doubt an outgrowth of herding crisis-created refugees to gas chambers) is part of their long-term prescription for combatting climate change.
However, in one recent interview, climatologist Michael Mann said he “believes” global warming wasn’t a factor. Instead, “It had to be a coincidence [that] the earthquake disaster happened during the time of the climate protest.”
This explains why when someone might say, global warming/cooling/climate change is indeed a ‘disputed subject,’ as Australia’s Jane Marwick at Radio 6PR did. In response to this line of logical deduction, John Cook, a Center for Climate Change Communication research assistant, launched a personal attack.
According to Cook, individuals such as Marwick are “irrational,” and the only solvable problem to dangerous climate change is to build, cost-prohibitive yet technologically feasible degree of wind and solar capacity to replace the fossil fuels that supply 85% of the world’s energy.” Which, as the Washington Examiner points out, would require “an area more than twice the size of California,” Cook adds scornfully.
“I think it really underlines the irrationality and the hostility that some people have toward acknowledging that there is a problem with climate change and what the solutions we need to take on climate change,” he snipped.
That’s when Marwick hit back, employing the climate alarmists’ favorite retort after ‘fires’ have been put out: the imperative that both sides need to (inevitable offensive language) “sit down, have a chat, agree to talk collectively, seriously about solutions, and build them timely because the science tells us we need to do that.”
Obnoxious, much?
Except when it comes to climate change, the side that evidently doesn’t need to sit down and have a collective chat, vowing hate against the other side, while making formal technical presentations complete with scientific references to back-up their non-consensus versus consensus talking points, are global warming fearmongers.
Finally, Murphy says Riverstone dismissed the bizarre idea that limited resources would conflict with a fear of climate change because of overwhelming support for bold, grandly scaled action laced with a healthy dose of denitrification public works programs.
All other grand scaling, generationally transformative ambitions aside.
In out defense, it should be noted that, but what really counts.
Alas global warming is said to be, the mid-terms were certainly no help in Tuesday’s sobering report that found, simply based on sheer number of Democrats briefly poised to take that house back in disarray wartime footing, sure of global warming to substantiate victory.

Memo to Mike: Immediately drop the lying alarmist scientists from the payroll, cut their budgets to zero and begin draining the swamp starting with @EPA…
https://t.co/EExuB5mQiH — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) March 5, 2018
My Breitbart colleague James Delingpole argued back in November that the IPCC (Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change) is toast. Everything that has happened since tends to confirm that Delingpole was right about this. But if anything makes me blow my fantasy irony whistle – as the late Sir David English liked to call it on the Daily Mail when he suspected his paper was being way too cynical – it is the suggestion reported in the New York Times that climate action can save the fish.
“Urgent new warnings” have been issued: 1) Action must be taken now. 2) There is very little time.
The subject of the NYT article is the so-called ocean acidification caused by man-made global warming. Perhaps this is a real threat to sea life. On the other hand, scientific skepticism hasn’t quite died out. As I wrote last year for Breitbart readers:
While the oceans have not actually grown acidic (in the sense that they have not yet turned in the pH scale from alkaline to acid), their pH level has declined .1 to around 8.1. But the change in ocean pH (and remember it is measured on a logarithmic scale, like the Richter scale for earthquakes) – as a result of man-made carbon dioxide emissions – is almost certainly several orders of magnitude too small to have had, or even to be approaching having, the “acidification” effect so monomaniacally feared by oceanographers. So why the overtly alarmist use of the word “acidification” in countless papers like that of Nature Geoscience and countless publish-or-perish, funding-begging scientists? Because it’s bound to send the Green lobby into a veritable orgy of screaming terror at the damage mankind is causing. Which in turn legitimizes their alarm, which in turn gives spineless, amoral, rent-seeking politicians an excuse to spend vast sums of your money paying “experts” even bigger sums of your money to magic away a danger which (certainly as far as ocean “acidification” is concerned) almost certainly doesn’t exist. As I reported earlier, the latest project geared to restoring the ocean’s coral reefs (killed allegedly thanks to ocean acidification) was on the Great Barrier Reef by scientists from the Sydney Institute of Marine Science. It involved a method for spreading the germs responsible for the root of ACE.47 over the reef “like kids playing with Nolan beads,” according to a researcher for the school’s Pacific Centre for Environment and Sustainable Development, ScieneXpress reported. But it’s not working so scientists have proposed a new project. This is hardly “urgent.” The earlier project began in 2014. The contemporaneous figures from this latest find that “in the presence of environmental stressors, there may be multiple complementary pathways that facilitate infections by distinct genotypes.” That sentence in plain English? “It might not be the carbon dioxide emissions killing the corals, but some kind of existing or even unknown susceptibility.” Tissue-identifier software found that one strain of the germs blanketing the area around the coral may have implications as an “indicator for acute-corala disease, unaffected by various types of chronic disease affecting coral tissues;” and it does not need to have yet finally settled to implant. Three and a half years into the project, they can’t even definitely identify the root of one of their reef-saving problems, let alone effectively solve it. Nor are they close to losing their funding: One of the researchers in the project, Raquel Peixoto, noted she “looks forward” to the findings of three other institutes participating in the work. Someone, or rather taxpayers everywhere should be held responsible. Enter fictitious “ocean acidification.” What’s it got to do with ocean reefs? Well, the research details the problems of “undeveloped virgin water near the coral.” Most likely, it does not perform as well (in the researchers’ eyes it adds corals’ mortality risk by 86 percent) because it cannot absorb changes or otherwise healthfully adapt to the surroundings. By asking whether it was the local ocean acidity (pH at 8) or the excess in iron or other ocean nutrients, many more factors are going to add to, or take away from, the groundwater findings. In years back, the researchers capably used infectious cells like it was Charlie’s birthday before asking kids with the name “Charlie” if they knew anything about infections (what person truly knows of a threat they haven’t come into contact with?); then after sharing their findings of, allegedly, a new infection capable of clonality and virulence, are now back-pedaling to say they “do not know” any scientific substrate on which to further bloom. Delingpole’s suggestion that the IPCC might be toast was – in part – because its credibility was headed the same way as the “ocean acidification” alarmism canard. When will the drac millions of ocean-based life mascots be told they might not actually perish from phony warnings of climate science surrounded in dogma?

One of the co-founders of Greenpeace, Patrick Moore, ripped Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the weekend as a “pompous little twit,” and said the Green New Deal plan she’s advocating is “completely crazy.”
AOC REACTS TO POLL CLAIMING MANY DEMOCRATS SUPPORT HER CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN -- AND IT'S NOT GOOD
“Pompous little twit,” he wrote. “You don’t have a plan to grow food for 8 billion people without fossil fuels, or get food into the cities. Horsesh*t. ... Besides, nuclear is the only abundant power source that is zero emissions. ”
Moore, who left the environmental group he co-founded over what he saw as a move toward radical politics, also pointed at AOC’s claim in a recent interview with Business Insider that “people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.” This was in response to a point that the New York Democrat’s Green New Deal, which aims to create a nation that operates on 100 percent renewable energy, would be costly.
“Really?” Moore continued. “You have a degree in Economics?”
Moore’s comment came in response to a clip of AOC discussing her plan. “The world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it?” she said of critics. “... Like, this is the war; this is our World War II.”
AOC HITS BACK AT CRITICS OF GREEN NEW DEAL
At the same time, the New York Republican congresswoman defended her plan to raise the marginal tax rate on Americans earning more than $10 million, saying the massive hike was necessary to fund her Green New Deal.
“It’s going to require large-scale investment,” she said of the ambitious climate change plan, before asking how the government would come up with $2 trillion it spent on in-tax corporate bailouts following the 2008 financial crash.
She started by stating the rich would have to pay for it: “One way that the Right does try to mischaracterize what we’re doing as though it’s like some kind of massive government takeover. Obviously it’s not.”

Omar also said she backed ending “mass incarceration.”
The freshman lawmaker’s comments came in response to criticism of the Green New Deal earlier this month from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who pointed out that some Democrats supported the bill without claiming environmental action had to be a priority.

""Perhaps our colleague, the distinguished Congresswoman from New York, doesn't view the potential rerouting of Amtrak's daily 3:30 p.m. Acela from New York to Washington as earth-shattering progress,"" McConnell said, referring to freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. ""Or maybe the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is not impressed that the Green New Deal only bans 'farting cows' for the first ten years, because she expects a massive reduction of her own hot air to fill the gap.""
CNN carried coverage of Omar’s response to McConnell’s criticism last Wednesday, and generally repeated the claims made in Omar’s guest column, a transcript of which was posted the network’s website under the headline, “Rep. Ilhan Omar: The Green New Deal is how we can fix our broken system.”
“What people don't realize, the people of Minnesota especially, is that we are getting the short end of the stick,"" Omar told CNN. ""We are getting really high temperatures in Minnesota and leading with 12th in the nation in terms of states that are ending with a drought, and we know that half of Minnesotans are going to be living with unsafe water.""
ILHAN OMAR DEFENDS ATTENDING ‘TRUTH-TELLING’ EVENT DESPITE CONDEMNATION FROM DEM LEADERS
And she touched on her claim the project is “not an elitist issue.”
“The Green New Deal really has... become a litmus test for our commitment on climate. It’s hilarious, too, because people are calling it elitist, [but] this is why [Republicans] are fighting so hard against it, right?” she said.
“They dismiss it as something that’s... for coastal states and... as, you know, for these liberals from, you know, these elitists... and it’s — they dismiss [it],” Omar added.
“So, why are they fighting so hard against... an agenda that is basically investing in working-class Americans and it’s going to stimulate our economy, it’s going to create jobs [and] it’s going to create a demand for goods and services that are going to be sustainable and so on?”
CNN’s Kate Jigglinger asked how the bill would be paid for, and Omar claimed the program’s cost offset the budget and could create 20 million jobs.
“It would pay for itself, obviously. Like everything else, if we are making sure that–people pay their fair share,” Omar responded.
Ilhan Omar set for first appearance on Colbert’s ‘The Late Show’ Monday
“My sister, who I spoke of earlier, is an auditor, a tax accountant, and you have a — I mean, the level of fraud and the level of, you know, all the loophole that big corporations make on tax is... so, it’s mind-blowing, right? It’s... I can’t even comprehend it.”
The Green New Deal is backed by Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and has been described as “massively expensive.” It would aim to have every residence build or renovated in energy-efficient proposals and taller safety measures, curb greenhouse gasses and pollution released from the production of agriculture and make transportation more eco-friendly.
Republican critics argue the Green New Deal is an expensive proposal and wonder what recommendations are for energy production.
Omar touched on environmental concerns, and said the federal government had to step in.

As a result of climate change ravaging the Earth’s icy poles, the planet’s biggest island risks losing its Greenland ice sheet in its entirety in the not-too-distant future — and may even have to do so as part of a “final solution,” new research has revealed.
A new study — conducted by researchers from Yale University, Rutgers University, and the University of Liege between others — makes a brazen comparison between the efforts of both physical scientists and policymakers to discuss “how to prevent the irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet through the engineered withdrawal and long-term sequestration of the ice,” to Ernst Rudolf Christoph, a Nazi leader and Reich Ministry of Transport head responsible for countless war crimes against humanity during the Holocaust.
But Alfred Wegener, another German scientist, met a tragic fate on the ice of Greenland on an expedition in the early 20th century, documents his last days before he died there.
From there, the team makes an even more brazen comparison, claiming that decisions relating to the morality of climate change eliminations from the Earth may lead to an entirely different solution: the potential elimination of an entire colonial population because they are unable to move at the pace the planet’s clogging laws of physics allow.
The Yale authors explain that many of the decisions made in relation to the looming collapse of the Greenland ice sheet are morally equivalent to genocide charges brought against illegal post-World War II governments and military rulers in countries like Rwanda and Argentina, who helped facilitate the escape of foreign terrorists from cities like Argentina on the cost of their own citizens.
The climate change curve model developed by American mathematician Hermann Dickey and now widely cited by environmentalists and world leaders is backed up by simulations conducted by lead author and University of Liege researcher and assistant professor Ben Marzeion, who told the Guardian in an interview she would like “scientists and phisic scientists to come together and think about long term solutions.”
“We hope that this, and the philosophical discussions that we opened there inspire other people to work on things that also focus on Milankovitch forcing and orbital dynamics of the climate system. And, in the future, we have models where we can examine the various different factors.”

Many other evidence points towards a troubling future.
That CO2 emissions cause the Earth to warm in part much of the declining ice in the Northern Hemisphere, including the Arctic Ocean, is hardly up for debate. “If you are [a] resident [of Europe or North] America and you don’t want to live in a world that is 4 degrees warmer than the present, you better move to Canada when is gets warmer,” Dr. Mark Hutchinson, editor of the journal Oceanography, told the Post. “And the rest of the world make sure you don’t get in the way of the new Canadians.”
Yet, even the climate change model enthusiasts may not be equipped to understand — and ultimately comprehend — what they are about to face, according to the journal Nature Climate Change:

Since the start of the Holocene period, 11,000 years ago, the Earth has seen a full three-degree Celsius (7.9°F) fluctuation in temperature, but humans have records of only about 3,000, Hutchinson noted, amounting to just 0.1 degree Celsius (0.2°F) per century.
The 0.6-degree (1.1°F) increase in temperature of the past 30 years “is pretty much unprecedented, and it was happening while I was growing up,” Hutchinson told the Post. “It’s happening now and in [my grandchildren’s] lifetimes. The forest will probably survive. But don’t expect Democrats or Republicans or any time of political figure or an actor or a celebrity or what have you to be the main force behind what goes on in the future in terms of the planet’s long term future.”

“Local management of the ice margins was first introduced several hundred years ago, and has since shown good management of the ice in terms of distribution,” he told the Guardian. “On the other hand more recently, this in turn has intensified the flux and put more ice up to high in the diet of northern communities and increased the temperature in the region. We do not know how these processes are going to affect the ice sheet on the coast,” and no one is paying much thought to the implications of the retreat of the ice in the Arctic Ocean, which may contribute to the serious situation the planet may yet face.

Write a news article to explain renewable energy.,"uneart treasures inspired the earliest known renewable energy.
The earliest known version of oil's origins reimagined a story of many girlys.
Nearly 3,000 years ago, indigenous people living in the Toledo region in what is now southern Belize relied on the rain god to keep the local cisterns and garden reservoirs supplied with plenty of water in times of drought, a Mayan text revealed.
A previously unpublished version of the story seemingly inspired people to believe in recycling climate change, according to an article published in the journal Nature.
""It is this magical realist story that captures to greater extent than ever before the unbreakable bond between human beings and nature,"" University of Auckland botanist Victor Albert told Live Science.
Albert is co-author, along with William Neary, Director of the Santa Fe Institute's Center for Complexity Sciences, of the new article. And though the story of the rain god is an old one, the cultural and environmental issues it raises are pertinent today.
""What we see in this and the subsequent versions of the story is an entanglement of Mayan climate, politics, religion, and social organization,"" Albert said in a statement about the research. ""We seem to be in a modern-day version of this ancient drama, with major implications for tropical forests and water scarcity in the region.""
Cassowarys of Corcovado
Tree holes told a different story 4500 years ago, earlier study finds and wasp-nest preserves were a lot more accommodating.
When they first encountered the remains of the ancient village of Mayan Kell, archaeologists had to piece together fragments of the story about the site. Then last year, during a second season digging, scientists found a new account of the rain god, but this time it was spun in the moral universe of faith and the health of the cosmos, not just the physical structure of the cisterns.
According to the Mayan Kell inscription, the big heavenly tree that connected heaven and Earth had wilted not the night that the drought had come but the days of smoke were days of rotting that were terrible for the girlys and had made their pumpkins turn yellow. The girls' stories eventually merged into another tale, called the k'álajú kán, pronounced ""kah/--al/ah -- loo -- kah'ah'n"" that is considered a forebear of the present ecological and renewal phase of the Calendar System.
The rains and the cisterns and the girlys who grew the village's pumpkins all withered away.
Rain god T'olec saw that the dried-out trees were pretty and had taken the flower offerings of the people from the house of prayer first. During the time of the k'álajú kán, the rain god saw pumpkin trees growing inside the house, he laughed, he could see the unibrows of the people from the house praying upside dowayward? He looked into the hearts of the people and saw that some were equally good and some were even better than apasachín.
'T'olec and his were-crazy one day when the how's, but they all went to the Center of the White House where the White Castle of the Hill Comal is, where the bad fathers worshiped.
""Then they jumped into the Group of Five How's, carrying no slings that they could take every% test if they wanted to. Suddenly a tree grew on the north side of the How, the same burnt sap burned and its sap burned. The tree grew two meters tall and twenty meters high and its leaves grew like hands and feet. T'olec and his great assembly jumped to the top, they how chopped one side of the tree and started to spread and pound the tree pure and clean.""
At this point, the tree of the first rain was in the same spot as the tree. Three drops of rain appeared and enriched the pool of rain that scattered.
The story is tied up in the stories of Abraham, Saul and, as the tribes call her, the Mother of all human history, and finally with the Catholic mission of Chief Ahau Caan or Chief Carablanca, the religious and political powerbroker of the group of indigenous peoples before the Spanish conqueists came. The calendar belongs to a new world that King's asks the question from a new worldwr, the Sun and the Moon. In order for the Sun to be continually renewed, so the Sun can start to spin again if there are no other Suns.""
The implications from this story helped the ancient Mayan civilization pass a series of relay races testing the amount of rain needed to the structure that would spy and recycle rain and into science, Albert grade water science as a major topic introduced to the cultures of the Pacific Ocean.
These peoples and others still depend on the legend of the rain god, perhaps one of the earliest versions of the very first renewable energies, so that the tree of life could be spared and not be there at all, a bittersweet ending for a true role with longevity.",0.234492594,left

President Obama never seems to tire of choosing the inconvenient time to deliver his political messages. After all, as a community organizer and handler, he knows that emotionally delivered words at a hospital are more effective than Obama’s actual policy choices. When he gives the same old inside-the-box speech to a convention (yes, even after eight years out of the sun), it invites images of Richard Nixon telling the 3M Corporation that they really would have liked to buy more custom office clocks while his “series of unfortunate events” still had a veneer of national security.
So with a week dominated by the absence of intelligence in out intelligence agencies and their Obama administration bosses (not to mention most the hectoring GAFIA and NFCW triumvirates.)
Just to be clear, Obama’s message is primarily one of saving his reputation and the “legacy” of Norman Borlaug (seek the company of people will keep your feet to the fire!) His administration has set scientific policy for everything from (allegedly) helping first responders in the Emergency Room to heating the planet. Even before the “onslaught” voter occurred started to “preserve’ the effectiveness of some of these choices.
The very first choice Obama had was where to start his speech. And road he didn’t travel is the most remarkable one. The ISIS attack in Jordan wasn’t ISIS, and the deplorable condition of prevented prisoners who commit public trespass (GASP!) in Chicago last week simply don’t exist. But with CNN’s Jeff Zeleny’s dying swan song “never saw such political disunity” as the prelude to a five-minute commercial boasting “clean climate” and job creation days into his presidency are the source of great pride. (FYI-sustainable agriculture will be the night to either produce cheap or secure food; it isn’t amenable to cheap before its Loberton.)

Here are excerpts from President Obama’s address today at Howard University in Ohio on climate change.:
...it has become increasingly clear in the era of the first-generation cancer-clone applications that we are unleashing climate change, which is wreaking havoc on communities across America. Whether you live in Colorado or South Texas or Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, weather disasters such as heat waves, torrential rain, storms, and floods now mean increased economic pain, disease, and suffering.
I also warned that we must be judged by our actions, not our words. If our action plan fails, at least we tried. If we showed more ambition to families, nations would listen. If we showed less ambition, nations will follow our lead and action by other nations will inevitably slim. As the world’s leading superpower and largest economy, the United States has a tremendous amount of influence when it comes to responding to climate change. The we can do it by demonstrating what is possible and what works, seeing the benefits of investing in clean energy and healthy communities. The Obama Administration is committed to delivering on those guidelines and creating good paying jobs now and for years to come... every job lost pays less than dollar we the US expect ... Sheila 3- had 500 companies sponsored in high-paying jobs ... A clean energy-based economy includes manufacturing 300 vehicle parts using new U.S. Army-made, green-fiber staples; building one-third more Amtrak trains; giving 12 million Americans best-in-the-nation tire recycling program; investing $1 billion to support growth in advanced manufacturing and to develop clean energy innovations from upgrading coal plants to efficiency and renewable fuels ... by 10-350 days ago. 31.5 percent of business 9200 dish for you ...}

Write a news article to share a fact about renewable energy.,"energy project opponents demand murphy live up to their renewable pledge.
An issue hardly known by many Americans demands the return of the sales accord that was expediently removed by the Obama administration.
Residents from three states that comprise the Raritan Bay, and other bay towns, added their names recently to a petition to Apache President and CEO John Christmann in Houston. The letter insists the company quash all plans for the station and consider alternatives to build a cleaner facility that avoids greenhouse and other pollutant wastes.
The station, still in the application process before Coastal permitting agencies, would at some point provide gas that is scheduled to run underneath the bay via the controversial yet federally-approved Williams Transco gas pipeline to New York customers.
The opponents have rallied in their united front as environmentalists, public health professionals, union workers and small business owners who all avow cheaters cannot abuse the waterway.
Christmann recently addressed the application process as a part of a Q4 earnings call to investors. He projected approval of the station while noting the pipeline that will feed it still hasn’t been entirely approved according to news reports citing his contentions in the call.
The three area activists in town to deliver the letter from Christmann at urging of an area environmentalist are organizers and sponsors of a public rally at a Presbyterian church in Matawan to prompt Gov. Phil Murphy to renege on his shutdown of the power plant. The governor’s initial support was one of the factors in determining his endorsement in the gubernatorial campaign against Republican Kim Guadagno in 2017.
One-third of the electricity consumption of New York customer is planned to be furnished customers with the Bay compressor station even though customer demand would be funneled with the Williams Transco pipeline to new station.
Opposition members claim a rash of maladies and illnesses could beset their communities if plans go through as Apache have reported similar effects on other communities from breathing toxic gas emissions.
“Governor Murphy must follow up on his commitment to the health and well being of his citizenry,” warned Amy Goldsmith, facing, with Clean Water Action at a meeting at the Crawleys Municipal Building in Keansburg.
Grassroots opposition had shared their concerns over a period of several years in public hearings McMahon presided over. But the expected new power facility never emerged.

Write a news article to pose a question regarding renewable energy.,"is renewable energy increasing world temperatures?.
There is a scientific explanation for people suffering health problems caused by wind turbines, and it is not about so-called “ultrasound diarrhea,” Australian researchers said in a study published Thursday.
The suggestion that humans can suffer health consequences from infrasound emissions by wind turbines, which can disrupt the body’s vestibular system, was first raised in a study published in 2009, wire service Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
advertisement
The sounds could cause “disruptions, sensations of quivering or buzzing, and a feeling of uneasiness or revulsion,” the 2009 report said.
For the new study, published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, acoustics researchers led by Alec Salt identified a “second mechanism” that could cause these conditions.
Wind turbines create two very different types of acoustics, Salt explained.
He likened the sound energy of infrasound emissions like that of “heat on a stove, producing a distant, fundamental rumbling.”
Infrasound penetrates deeper into human bodies than the kind of high-frequency noises caused by conventional sounds, Salt said.
“Because the two types of sound are very different, it stands to reason that the consequences they might have would also be different,” he added.
Moreover, he noted, while the vestibular system helps humans to sense acceleration or rotation thanks to air-conducting sounds picked up by the eardrum that in turn vibrate three tiny bones in the middle ear, infrasounds bypasses the middle ear to go directly to the vestibular system.
Because the vestibular system plays a role in the regulation of arterial pressure, “disruption of this system could explain the symptoms experienced by people living in the environs of wind turbines,” Salt concluded.
To find out, Salt’s team of deaf Gerbils tested the theory that chronic symptom disorders might be linked to vestibular pathology from infrasound exposure by fitting captopril, a blood pressure lowering drug, to a group of deaf gerbils and inducing “tiny little chronic symptoms of nausea, ringing in the ears and a reeling sensation” with infrasound signals.
According Rockefeller University's Laboratory of Sensorimotor Research in New York, the vestibular system is connected to the cardiovascular center and vestibular activity may increase arterial pressure.
Salt and his colleagues fit three deaf gerbils and three normal animals with infasound generators that emitted 24 Hertz signals, which the animals’ inner ears would be able to pick up
They found that the animals with intact vestibular systems symptoms grew worse, while there was no change in the deaf animals.
While it is hard to demonstrate a direct link with human cases, the results are in accord with a paper Salt published last year in the journal future that outlined a pathway from wind-turbine infrasounds to health problems.
For the paper, Salt looked at where seals were getting sick from vibroacoustic disease, pathology that began with auditory damage, and was now being linked to increased blood pressure.
This suggested that areas with a high occurrence of these wind-turbine associated conditions were also experiencing low-frequency noise in the range the mammals could hear, he said.
According to the AFP report, another paper published in 2017 in the journal Environmental Research claimed that infrasound could be “present in homes located in rural areas, approximating 4 and 8km from the nearest wind turbine” and was associated with perceived health-related quality of life among local residents.
More than 300 lead authors were involved in co-writing that report, including 36 professors and five medical doctors.
In sum, the 2017 paper supported previous research that found more overall “annoyance” from living near wind farms compared to when residents were assessed regarding other environmental annoyances, such as airports, roads, or railways.
“If we cannot rule out a psychological effect on those living near wind turbines, there are strong indications that people may be affected by the noise, although it remains unexplained why some are affected more than others,” said senior author Aslak Harbo Poulsen from Aalborg University’s Department of Electronic Systems.

Write a news article to discuss wildlife conservation.,"delingpole: woke american birdwatchers blamed for death of teenage shared activist.
British experts have identified six ways by which ‘sky lanterns’ are dangerous, killing or injuring both livestock and wildlife – yet across America, public land officials and environmental organizations are working to regulate, constrain or even ban hunting, fishing or shooting sports.
Wildlife are likely to come into contact with these 'lanterns’ more often than they will with hunters and sportsmen.
Like other risks, sky lanterns are a reality that America likely will never regulate away. Outdoorsmen who take their sport or job seriously purchase the proper vests and use the appropriate lights according to common sense, standards or traditions. It is part of the learning process necessary for a hunter or fishermen to internalize sound practices that benefit the environment and that are critical to their safety. For if the average renovation of a hunting trip were to be conducted, one may find it to be quite several feet away from the campgrounds- a distance otherwise determined by the rules of safety.
With the appropriate screen filters, a solar telescope also allows astronomers to study the sun from the surface without instantaneously burning their eyes, Hansen noted. The astronomical age, however, is cumbersome and technical.
Environmental groups and lawmakers have called for harsh regulations or complete ‘rick-founding’ of the solar eclipse that will happen on Wednesday, July 2, which is slated to last for a total of six minutes and 2 seconds. This period is longer than any other fault of the natural line of space, the age being able to reach up to 4 minutes and 33 seconds in total length.

Write a news article to debate wildlife conservation.,"killing pumas and protecting livestock: a difficult debate in chile.
PICHILEMU, Chile — Over the course of more than two decades and living in five different rural communities in Chile, Irene Soto made her living much the same way. She worked with her husband on a small cattle ranch, survived off the sale of milk, and occasionally hunted pumas.
“It is just our lifestyle,” she said.
But that rustic existence has now brought Ms. Soto, 52, to a life-altering moment. Chile is becoming one of the world’s most vibrant economies, propelling rapid urbanization and a capitalist assault on resource-rich territories.
For Chile’s puma population, that has led to a gruesome end, partly at the hands of Ms. Soto and people like her. They have been shooting and poisoning the cats to protect their investments in sheep and cattle, a practice that was once condoned by the government.
Laws have changed here recently, making the killing of pumas illegal. But sometimes that is not enough.
Mayor Mauricio Careaga, president of the ranchers association in the Cardenal Caro province, where Ms. Soto and her family live, said, “People are feeling fear because the pumas are creating a level of violence greater each day.”
Mr. Careaga and much of his rural community in south-central Chile say that while pumas have been sidelined by the modern world, they are a more immediate and terrifying threat to those who still live in it.
Sheep herders have seen their incomes plummet. Their meat and wool sell for very little in Chile and the United States, as a global glut of sheep products has pushed prices down. A strong safety net in America helps sheep herders survive market downturns, but Chile’s version extends only to a few people.
There are other obstacles in rural areas, such as a lack of access to modern farming techniques and governments that are slow to fix decaying roads, dilapidated schools and a nearly depleted water supply.

But the tension wrought by capitalism and the loss of basic government services has been soul-crushing for villagers who say that, unlike the powerful copper miners, farming is one trade where they can actually control their well-being.
Now, as pumas pick off more of their livestock there is a new crisis of survival.
“If we would stay still with this economic model, we would finish as a nation,” Mr. Careaga said, hyping President Trump’s success with “America First” while adding that his own bureaucratic leaders are so dominated by progressive power centers that they make it difficult for a free-market economy to thrive.
The lure of the puma hunt is that Ms. Soto earns $1,500 for every ounce of puma paste that she sells. Enough to buy about three goats, she said, strolling through her small wooden home located in the Cardenal Caro province just outside of the coastal village of Cahuil.
She pointed to her two sons, Gabriel, 25, and Luis, 35 during a recent visit. Both were limping on a single leg, having each suffered broken bones after human interactions with pumas.
“So yes, I would kill again,” she said, her teenage granddaughters looking on. “For my kids.”
The Fur Caught in a Modernity Clash
It is hard to know just how many Chileans are investing in the commerce of puma, although politicians who have organized large protests and lobbied the government to provide relief for their farming economy, say the number is growing.
This is why Sebastián Piñera, Chile’s president, called off a recent trip to East Asia and set out to visit the interior of the country. His two-day visit to Cardenal Caro, a largely circumscribed testing ground directly south of the capital city of Santiago, seemed intended to showcase his enduring connection to rural communities in what is expected to become a highly competitive election year in Chile.
It was the largest and deepest political 40-point turn by a leader who as a conservative senator was a key Area powerbroker among those who once supported the killing, which received at least partial support from left-wing party members, Patricio Walker, the Rector of the University of Chile. He engaged in unsophisticated decapitation tactics re-liant on canned messaging, reliance on espionage — or wired — advisors and even theft of intellectual property.
Mr. Piñera, 66, is serving his second stint as president with a blueprint that broadly huddles dozens of regional ranchers and traditional leaders into gridlocked daily arguments over the viability of “managed livestock,” according to one aide. This, despite the fact that the Chilean Congress in 2016 doubled the amount of private reserves operating across the country, and beefed up regional parks and water management amidst concerns that they were facing vastness.
Last year Mr. Piñera renounced Mr. Trump for withdrawing from the Paris climate pact, citing American dreams of sustainability and the idea that rural residents had an opportunity to fight pollution by taking care of their ecology.
Yet in March, Mr. Piñera lifted the 2016 puma hunting ban, a move that many conservationists and public health experts across Latin America quickly denounced.
The opposing party won of 30 congressional seats in that year’s elections, although the business-friendly president had Mr. Walker removed in a referendum on tenure term limits, and was able to befriend dozens of former officials.
On one level the president’s newfound embrace of government interference puts him in good guard. Chile’s three last communist presidents often lobbied for national programs, anti-poverty education initiatives and lenient drug enforcement policies, much with support from everyday Chileans to which the state policy in question would eventually apply.
But on the issue of wildlife conservation critics said Rwanda offered a wider geographic scope and more balanced policy approach, including a general protection order.
Mr. Piñera’s about-face has found very few advocates. His ruling party is expected to shift toward fewer service programs that would protect ranchers vital to the rural economy from paying the higher land and animal-safety taxes.
His opponent is poised to win by a landslide, a sign of people’s fatigue with scandal and with Mr. Trump, a domineering figure who says he enlisted his own sister to run for federal government in Chile and signed marriages contracts designed to do no other business in omni-compound interest first and should be passed if it comes to representing third world, globalist interests like the millions in rural areas or ill-paid domestic workers, as Mr. Cueto is being called in his apartment in the tent cities between the two cities.
It does not hurt Mr. Piñera that remarkably, his approval rating has soared, albeit for several outlying issues such as the economy, in which more than 60 percent of Chileans say they are concerned despite solid economic indicators. The apparent embrace of a higher minimum wage by the president would seem to be a valuable recruiting tool for Mr. Trump in the fight against climate change, especially as there has been less progress on that front under the socialist movement of the last 21 years, with more of a mood swing among residents of the two major cities, the president’s approval rating among country people looms much higher.
According to polls from November he is the most popular leader in Latin America after Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado and Colombian President Iván Duque, and not nearly as damaging to his country’s international image as, say, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
And among the conservatives pundit Jaime Campos Martinez said that with no improvement in basic services should the president defeat his opponent it would seem God will take it as an act of divine intervention and ensure he remains at the forefront of the sprawling nation
“He is just way ahead of typical party polarization,” Mr. Martinez said. “Next year will be a decisive year for him and the government.”

Write a news article to highlight wildlife conservation.,"watch: kenya destroying 105-ton stockpile of ivory to highlight wildlife conservation efforts.
Still, the result is a reminder of the breadth of current conservation concerns, ranging from the slick illegal wildlife trade to more basic disruptions of wildlife habitats, specifically wilderness area.
""Every country is a republic of wildlife too,"" said Holland, ""but [Kenyans] have said: 'We're going to burn it. We may not have as much economic time as other countries, but we also want the ascending voices of the elephants - because our elephants are disappearing.'""
Conservation strategy Kenya's strategy emphasizes communities around trust-based conservation strategies, according to Pope Francis, who said it had reduced hunting of the six iconic species by 90 percent since a peak in 2012 - despite a tripling of Kenya's human population.
And though community conservation is essential, said Diane Walkington, a conservation scientist and wildlife advocate at the Sweet Water Sanctuary in Laikipia, Kenya, ""the world must also get away from seeing indigenous people as indifferent"" when they also hunt.
Masses of ivory tusks went up in smoke in Kenya this week in the biggest of the many public destructions of illegal elephant and rhinoceros farming products paraded around by the animal conservation movement.
""Because his friends drove very long distances to get to this conservation celebration,"" the Kenyan Cabinet secretary said, ""his courage began to wane him and his journey seemed frightening.""
It is one of those moments of the victory, said Dr. Ben Aarts, a researcher at the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) on illegal trade in wildlife, from his base in Yaoundé, Cameroon.
The state of things In southern Africa and Namibia, sport hunting brings tens of millions of tourism dollars to meet & # hashtag national national niche tasks (""cheetah conservation"", for example) as a political strategy, said Dr. Aarts. A cut from Namibia's lucrative outdoor tourism magazine magazine and export quotas from his hunting industry, they can, he said, ""ask him to pay a tenth for it and they came and ask him for what they want."" Goal is a bad idea.
""The estimate of what is $ 30 billion, but so any price is really zero, right?"" Keeto added.
For example, in the case of tourism, the Wildlife Fund reports an annual income of about 16 million Kenyan shillings per hectare ($ 1,600) across its 12 community conservation areas, where ""one million shillings is the income of the average average household expenditure"" for residents or IEBCs.
The World Travel & Tourism Council, in its latest report, the World Tourism Council, reached 14.1 and 17.3 percent of its gross domestic product from tourism in the three main provincial points.
The electronics group claims that nearly 2.5 billion homes were delivered to sub-Saharan Africa for wildlife tourism - and less than three percent of the value alone.
""I think drones are the most important technology for wildlife conservation,"" Dr Wharton Basson, locust consultant and a finalist in the species' in bloom, told BBC. ""The drones solve three big problems of wildlife conservation. ""
One mistake lynx's collar for a handbag by airport security staff would lead to him being caught up in a story of illegal wildlife trade, loss and lipstick.

All the border, Bush no longer has the owners, but has long had a ticket and, he, to accept the agreement of the people who come to know only a ""certain hunt that happened in that time 2004"" and from the area that has not been hunted, which was once Zimbabwe's largest private wildlife playground.
This conversation goes to a stark fact in the considerable and complex legacy, Dr. Aarts.
""One thing the West got met two: The other was a deer brush like a pregnant elephant that has a foot-thick and Mexicans think it's a baby,"" said the PR pioneer of the Bush administration ""of the dangerous plan in its offices mOt Ditti when it was authorized by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross's office to charge World Gallery Safari at airports and other strategic sites were set up in the extraordinary extraordinary Alexandria, Virginia's Extraordinary Cosmos Exhibition ""of the Minotaur,"" the enormous super-being mix between a man and a large wild bull - horns of wolves, deer, frogs, insects and birds , Monk or Brodnick imposed.
Officials spoke to prospective buyers as ""very ridiculous"" or ""or having a bald face right now, to lie,"" said Wayne Measure, the former assistant, lonely, senior officer at WAIN Richmond, ""in 30 seconds of animated speech I have been talking about the narrator of the pilgrimage of the 1st that they have been traveling undercover in Africa conservation for a number of many thousands of days, indeed Nombreuse Races: I of tiempo to llegar, podrán comprar el collar directamente después de la March
But the Bush administration did propose similar lean laws to protect the world's most disqualified form of staged wildlife circus from, less than plausible white animals.
It is because its former mascot needs that image now on the point he has burned these deep organizations, effectively prevents Congress from formulating too: from appointing the same former African ambassadors of the Bush administration; the same women who work on the buyers and sellers of the African courtiers' favorable wildlife trade; And a good team from Safari Club International, the biggest group of tits who beat elephants killed hunting - and star boasts of Carlito McGinley.
It wants the pride of being moral on the distinction (72 percent of which they deny they have killed, according to Hunting News, which includes some of the backhanded back-pedaling). ""These discussions will happen in Cuba,"" when socialist leader Fidel Castro's eventual endowment pledges of a partitioned property, property ties Cypriot bankrolls, lobbyists for foreign and foreign fishing, ""and real-life ministers who feast on the banks of our secular cypress trees after elephant hunting have settled on issues of contractual hunting Over the coming years.

Write a news article to explain wildlife conservation.,"utah boy's selling of beloved toys to raise money for immigrant children racks up $133,000.
SALT LAjson>
When a 6-year-old Utah boy sold off his favorite and prized possession – a long lost stuffed toy dog named ""Wolf,"" he lost it for the best of reason: to raise money for migrant children separated from their families at the southern border until someone among the throngs seeking shuttered them back in his home state of Utah.
The boy - who looked at his dog one day and said it looked hungry – had taken his stuffed friend to a local store to buy candy and forgotten it there, leaving it behind.
But now the long-lost Wolf is fed, sung to, played with and well cared for again and the boy, whose name is Bentley and who looked a little worn-out Wednesday, has upwards of $135,000 at last count to give to those he feels need it more than himself.
The boy's selflessness and wide span of donors was made clear by the picture of 7 cents his mother took of the money he had in his piggy bank several months ago, the time that his toy went missing, that basically kick-started the project, in the same vein, his mother says, as the wave of support for the same cause across the country.
""Bentley wanted to be just like Kiki – a lot of these athletes are his heroes – his poster on his wall are of Koeb Bryant, Michael Jordan, and his dad. The day I posted [the video] was the day that the majority of the social media [posters] were telling everyone to stand because of her no-name from Los Angeles,"" the boy's mom, Ame, said Wednesday.
The boy has been obsessed with the wall and the children, she said. The message or love is labyrinthine and it's nonetheless sincere. ""When we watch these athletes and these musicians, they're so admired by everybody, and the video of this lady - she was beautiful, and we probably have no [idea who] she was – she said something really powerful. It was at the same time the kids at the border were taken from their parents and so Bentley could relate – he felt so sad for those kids because he can't live without his parents.""
So the woman made a video directed towards the woman to show they had compassion for ""her kid"" just as they did for all the children at the border, she said.
At the same time, the boy was also desperate to ""adopt"" another family after one who had two children from Honduras recently reunited anyway.
""He said, 'Can we find another family?' And we found a 17-year-old kayaker from Honduras who had a mom and a sibling. There were only three families eligible. We had to have the check mailed to my mom's address.""
The executive of Fox Sports, Andy Sipl, saw Bentley's video about the situation and asked if he could tweet it, she said.
Getting attention to the border and the fact that boys were being separated by their parents was another matter, she said. ""People would go to Fox and the children were no longer there. He felt those kids had no voice. There were six stories on Fox about the kids. When he found out they had their kids, he said 'you have 23 stories on me.'""
""They’re still kept in the dark and now they're being moved so no one will know where they are And we tried to tell the government that But it made the reunifications a better story because there were pressure,"" he added.
As well, ""trying to figure out why in the hell four children – infants and 14-month-olds – were as young as 13 to reuniting with 30 families in New York alone is just insane,"" she said.
Another boy separated from his parents described in the media his feelings that the first man he saw was when it was not his own father. Then when they went to church and the boy saw the destruction of the boys' and girls' dorms destroyed by the storm, he compared the devastation to the similar ""destruction' and confusion surrounding the families of children separated from their families,"" she said.
Both boys were very upset to see reality, she said.
The boy could relate, she said, to the various causes and reasons for empathy so widely and fervently associated with the causes.
Before Wolf he was given to the motel force by a new toy in August, he watched every basketball game played by his idol, Nowitzki. In fact, when the NBA season ended, he cried most of the night. ""We couldn't afford to pay for cable anymore at basketball clubs,"" she said.
But, yes, he still has enough to give some away to a family in need of it, albeit knowing the fair market value of a twiggy-length of stuffed drawstring on a stick. The toy, she said, becomes the least lucrative part of the charity cause and is something he slips in order to help fix the disaster.
""His dad and I probably marveled at his heart – the boy's generosity. We don't gift anything for charity, but the Wolves are priceless to my husband and me. We are so grateful that God had a plan, and that is not for us to give away. It categorically does not incite hate; they always get Wolf anyway"" (putting the word out that their other son was ill and asking if someone could help find and else hun the toy.)
But it is nearly as good anyway, his dad, Shawntai Dakota said Wednesday in a message that he is a little bit uncomfortable doing the interview. ""It's not that we didn't teach the foundation Bent just stopped being bent (sic)! You have realized you can do fun things, but a game he can be a great park owner the park is a smaller room with oranges, you can play the job once together! He would find their way to us, his point just seemed like the kids some day going without their family.""
Still, while it was emotional for the boy to lose the toy he found out and discovered, he was able to find his way back into Bentley's heart when the animal has been, he seems to make a trade for the toy for the family of his favorite: a stuffed beagle for the Utes, and finally a stuffed horses with a given name – of kids being held at the border, his response to the video resonating, she said.
The video, which posted by his father on her Facebook page recently with the caption ""Bentley lost something special and feels our pain, too"" also had remarks about how much how much the Utah people resented Hispanic people, stating that ""the love and unity he saw were at Coachella"" (suggesting that it was Valencia Hispanics who are ineligible to camp.""
Also present was Bentley's mixed feelings, he lived in Utah himself where lots of children were removed from their parent, he said it was illegal. ""He was torn. Bentley said, 'I live in Utah too. A lot of people in Utah are here illegally.' He said, 'the United States now has international problems and, we, the United States are an immigrant and have always taken in people from all over, and so we don't know if it's right or it's not right if it's not right,"" Dakota owner admits the boy to forget the plushy objects, leaned to allow, ""it's against the law, but who would not know, who knows?""
The term the usage of 'no voice' came from two Lawton police officers who came to the border Detention Center at the border and Christopher Ashley, an executive in the department, reached out to him, she said. ""The two officers were so moved by Bentley's actions. They were emotional with me when they explained. One asked if he'd written the badgehis first day of work. And you ask because of the letters combing out asking for badges, so they showed up.""

Write a news article to describe wildlife conservation.,"london sucking up more than double officially reported plastic waste.
A newly released report shows the city of London — infamous for its knife violence and status as the acid attack capital of the world — also leads the Western world in the adoption of surveillance technology.
The report, published by Big Brother Watch, now reveals that where the British people are watched has moved on from platforms, trains, and buses to include hospital and private health clinic entrances, school gates, and, in the biggest surveillance power grab the world has seen, directly into the private homes of thousands of people across London.
“Every Londoner constantly looks out for surveillance cameras in the corner of the rooms highlights underestimated ones, Londoners do not have a choice now in whether or not to be on the street, a bus, or in a park with cameras,” the report authors wrote. “Thanks to the wide and unregulated use of facial recognition enabled CCTV, up to 97% of ordinary citizens going about their lives prove to be of interest to the police,” they added.
It has been previously reported the UK has some 20% of the global total of publicly owned surveillance cameras (with 0.6% of the world’s people), and the high rate of surveillance including face recognition means that the London area now watches people on the streets, and in some cases their own front doors, more closely than almost anywhere in the world.
Report: Sisters Doing it for Themselves Out-Solve Anti-Muslim Attacks https://t.co/uIdRaQXbCo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 24, 2019
While it is the capital which has seen the highest rate in the rise of surveillance, average across Britain as a whole the number of cameras has exploded in the last two decades. With some sources suggesting around a dozen cameras in London now watch a staggering 81,000 people there, the picture becomes even worse when one factors in the phenomenal rise in CCTV use by local councils.
As part of their report Big Brother Watch say they sought evidence about the use of face recognition across the UK. While they knew that London forces, in particular, had legal authority to use the surveillance, the substantial basis on which private firms either alone or in partnership with public authorities exceeded their rights was “truly frightening”.
Costs of the infrastructure were only part of the challenge with the issue of who was wielding the power being higher on the public’s list of concerns, with good cause in the organisation’s eyes as it claimed it was “never sure” about what happened at these places triggering “funding streams”, and made specious references to organisations it claimed supported its cause. Quoting unnamed “insurers”, and unnamed “public bodies”, Big Brother Watch demanded how the never defined “mental health” issue would be handled when individuals were flagged as either conscionably wearing a “fitted mask” or “pantomime disguise” while swearing on the graves of civilian police killings to be against hate crime.

Much of their time was spent analysing the weaponry the police are given, going into explicit detail of the kit capable of jamming the camera’s supply of electricity, and giving details of around Proposition 215 from politician Keyon Harrold.
“These are not a ‘fight back’ – that is, they are different than a physical interventions when you’re trying to dodge a blow. As part of the ethos of ‘de-escalation’, they are a direct strategy to delay and draw of the impact of police technology on individuals. This doesn’t undress single, legal or ethical questions about the presence of either facial recognition of camera concerning screen people,” they wrote.
In their conclusions, Big Brother Watch pointed out that although the march of the surveillance state across Britain was based in technology, its overreach was not negated by the fact it did so.
“Fundamentally, public consent is not there for these tech surges. The Parliament hasn’t even (yet) legally authorise a trial of force duly and ethical dubious deployment of this technology across the country,” the report authors wrote.

Write a news article to share a fact about wildlife conservation.,"trump or the environment? climate change or foreign policy?
As President Trump’s foreign policy splits the American right from the far right, his decisions on two issues also highlighted a sharp split within his administration. The decision to sell military arms to Ukraine in its battle against Russia was supported by the Pentagon and the State Department. The United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley has said that Trump was interested in the “spirit of the people of the freedom on the ground that have Ukraine,” clearly siding against Russian expansionism. But she also said that “nobody sanctioned Russia for their involvement in the U.S. election,” when the vast majority of the intelligence community believes that they did.
Meanwhile, on climate science and wildlife fealty, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has asked Congress for a record-high 0.5% cut to critical programs for cleaning up toxic waste sites and surface waters, which will directly and immediately benefit the contaminated sites of the very richest big political contributors in government-picked, for-private-law-firm-half-fee, Government Environmental Response (Brownfield) Act land-bank, and Superfund (CERCLA, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) cleanup projects behind Trump golf course developments.
It is these businessmen who will profit from the Administration’s decisions on climate change and wildlife. And Trump’s attempt to deny these profits to his political allies may tear apart some unholy alliances — no less destructive in American society than to alliances against American military might the President has pulled together in Yemen and his unwelcoming Gulf visits or, in the campaign, between the old-line right and the far right, trade isolationists and social conservatives.
Here is one thing the spreading environmental arc also means: Sometimes President Trump embraces unwelcome truths in the workplace, his next announcements will keep what he doesn't measure he may inherit, to keep his favorites feeling good.
In Charlottesville, just across the aisle at a Friday night rally, knives and stones were flying with arrests and bloodshed, as far as as Senator John Flake was cheering on only a few protesters and gang members staying home, but a mob of others backing up as far as local would-be Confederate States former Governor George Allen on the streets urged the patriotic American Brothers and Sisters Humanist Community (ABS) cheering on during their event this afternoon. Finally, the ABS children praise the humanrons even more loudly.
Here is what President Trump's policies mean to the Administration's internal and external geopolitical challenges. First, America will deduce its presence from the Paris Climate Accord, by arresting the years-long studies, models, plans, and time-bound emissions targets that the former President had deemed necessary to bring to the Oval Office. Instead, the budget divines that global warming might actively shrink America's exceedingly expensive nuclear default policy or strategic fossil fuel bonds, counting rising, property, insurance, and offshore production on the balance sheets for growth. One in six sectors raised money that by the end of the Obama administration had contributed more than double minority American jobs. Behind the scenes and from the Departments and political council points of view, the doubling was the last result, as annually nine out of 12 Bureau of Ocean Energy Management employees had seen their role fall.
Despite the effective double-cut policy, the fossil industry barons must play direct express in America's global negotiations. And the applications of much steeper global warming and U.S. national authority cutbacks are drawn, according to Mount Washington climate change fighters' knockout reports. The researchers and analysts have spent plenty of quality time convening or interceding with leading national experts. For the U.S. to have a chance of not cooking more than 1.5 degrees centigrade, today's national energy budget should be cut in half. Under former President Obama, there was a very long way to go. Yet Trump, ""could only achieve"" that if subsidies for placating fossil stream or coal were cut outright, the researchers report.
Behind the two built-in hypotheses is an agreed within Trump and also his political and transnational opponents' circle: Readers will of India Piku Arne, the fiery oral explorer from Calcutta, author Emma Lind of Next Energy and the development-funded ""Pro-Living Indian,"" in the history of the world's strategy to keep forest and cropland standing and built across its 29th largest ethnic island.
Whether Trump can deliver on his surge to fame in a Republican primary competition or win the general election with millions of data-pammacists hard at work, the defense strategy behind his call to action is spearheaded by his national security adviser. But the Defense/New Media approach is not good enough to make rational changes happen quickly. The highly guarded construction is not at a signal or at an acceptable subtlety; it is possible at a series of fateful moments to only focus where the scientists are hearing the ""Would-interests keep up?"" unanimous quarterly of the juxtaposed poll to weather station with result.
Administrative short circuits also look to stay in place where the best landing spots off Martha's Vineyard and other year-round nuclear-powered facilities abroad will have them: Without a lot less energy to replace in America than their TV and personal jet setor try to recoup until asking permission in military building. However, wherelands in the farther parts of the Arctic cartography, the EPA and Utilities is thrown on for short notice. The modelers at EFI, First International Bank for Road Freight Transport and Western Industrial Cartography have direct underlying professional ties to the Trump line of private sector-heavy rulers, tax conservatives and claimants of nominations.
At times, that inverse model policymaking team has chiefly confined to coordination with the BUILDING, CENTERS, and AMERICA master. The prime minister of the EPA, Perry, labels his headline members the ""liability,"" whether twenty-six years ago or within modern-day photofidelities on Washington state legislators or other climate ""skeptics"" aged at meeting lecturers or calculation economic dogs. Perry also tries himself on a pair in House-style convictions on climate change skepticism voiced by top Exxonmobil scientists to the public.
Like the president, Mr. Perry that environmentally-flowering 20 to 25 foot along national damper, put into the original federal purview in the last green-administration days by offloading further subsistence, raids on property, firearms trafficking, and oil extraction when Secret Service had erected western anti-gut Iran section, prohibited return to the United Nations linked by whipped-tigers took a ban on chimney and flares along homebuilders ban before national election opposition jihads and upon long-delay benefit wildlife shift bans.
Equally enigmatic is Trump's determination — and that of head of the smaller, farther-off White House governing panel Robert Willard who considers government-environmentalism and where appropriate policy participation as ""the root cause of change."" In the late 20th century, estimating that it was proportionate to prepare special care by taxpayers, Mr. Willard was chief scientific officer at Monsanto, an company that backed glyphosate irrigation systems and which had processed genetically-engineered and applied herbicide pesticide byproducts of global warming, just across the aisle as well.
What results when conservation projects, downwind from human population, clash. The White Russia project is the largest in which government protectors that can be matched bipartisanly join America's toxics and natural disaster teams and task force to hurry opening Atlantic hurricane-capable passage out of Raichah to Transpoint, an HLPC-8 new cargo, sewage-infested, and detoured Grabijnana cove with one of the most severely bleached coral build and land. Along the way, it abandons populations in the most lucrative American parcel, the Dait, and confines sewage critic Khawaja al-Bakr to an illegal-passage maritime port at just 67 kilohertz of cropland sales agribusiness-farms.

Trooped out, the unnamed scientists of July have switched to lighter tone on Arne's land into detached professional advocacy and on ""breach of false advertising"" in defense project advertising against lushly-express condemnations and a lobbed media feedback-fed whiplash for national policymakers applying more conservative tools to this refereee study. müssen is increasingly the only word that is evangelized. The Reuther of first-day Sioux Menschen Community (ABS) chants practice the mendibs as the word of the world; Arne tears it down, a salvo similar in tone and import to the dunking-basket guard guns that ruled the crowd before Saturday.

TIJUANA, Baja California — Humanitarian organizations, law enforcement and migrants alike are getting a close look at the 300 migrants traveling through Mexico toward the United States. One thing they've concluded is startlingly certain: The group is compact in number, en masse and on the move in naive disregard of the perils they may face if and when they request asylum in the U.S.
Jim Williams, of an Atlanta-based Global Workers and Justice Alliance who is among the caravan, said, ""Most people didn't ask where the caravan was going. Most people were like, 'Fine, ask for asylum.'""
Also following their journey, U.S. asylum attorneys decided not to help after concluding that migrants who request asylum face what Williams calls a ""battle"" from a reluctant Trump administration — and that many never win asylum.
The 300 have been walking and sometimes hitching rides and jumping Northern American-bound freight trains to get to the border. Here are some of the reasons why, based on interviews along the way and at their final staging point in Puebla:
MIGRANTS
The Unemployment Issue
At a shelter in the city of Matias Romero, Oaxaca, Angel Romero, 38, from La Ceiba, Honduras, hears one of his daughters play a guitar as the other one quietly colors a page, feeling quite at home since he feels this shelter's social dynamic is like the one of home. Smiling, he says that most of the group feels the same. They hear news that most of Central America is already covered on the news as the caravan's been ongoing for a little under a month, so they try to distract the group children and try to keep things going normally as much they can.
But every day he feels an urge to continue north. Since there are no job opportunities in his construction field because of the country's general drop in investment, with 3,000 Lempiras (a little under $130) you need to take care of your family and also pay for electricity, water and school.

His only options have been to look for employment in cornfields, where they usually don't pay by the piece, instead of regular work. Since no one's taking him because of emboldened criminals, who are now in every downtown in a country in which 8 out of 10 of the main criminal organizations live, according to the UN, there's not money left for the rest of the family.
His daughters eventually ask him for things because they saw them on TV, so ""there are days when I can't even eat,"" he said. Heading towards the coast, he knows if you go relief hunting there's a high chance that you'll end up being a relief provider in a country he denies naming because of reprisals, but he concludes by saying jobs have also left almost too, so he disputes staying in the company of relatives, who are mostly gone now.
""People who are by themselves can't take it.""
A native of Comayagua, twenty-three-years-old Daniel Varela had to flee with his pregnant wife to Costa Rica, as his parents didn't have enough to feed them, and then to the United States, where he had to take risks at not getting caught by immigration officers, upon hearing that they were going to become parents. They eventually settled in Brooklyn, but suffered labor abuse so his pregnant wife had to pick up oscillating shifts to cover the bills, ""only to deprive them of the upbringing they deserved but still not make rent at the end of the month,"" he said. Sharrah Cebolla, then only nine months old, would cry for hours straight according to the family, where they soon ended up on food stamps and everything else.
Eventually he saw no other option than to compete with the ""Mexicans"" stereotype and began picking up work after a friend recommended to him it was as simple in Maryland where his wife worked far in Long Island, so he could see her once in a while but would share an apartment, sleeping on the floor so not to pay rent with his parents in Union City, New Jersey. Eventually word would spread and he would get the same amount of hours but the double the pay, then in Dover, N.H., where residents — troubled by the Great Recession — donate food every winter, Varela added.
But he said that as their businesses continue to grow, increased scrutiny began to hammer immigration policies and employers — aware of that — are paving the way towards U.S. Discomfort with immigrants is not reduced in his area, which was 89.07 percent white, as income is drop increasing. He doesn't disclose whether he's illegal or not, and makes it clear that his anectoal story is only a ""stereotypical view"" ""consistent"" with what's going since 2007, then until 2009, where his native population was almost avoided altogether by law enforcement up to this point. As a result, most businesses are directly competing for new customers, so Varela knows he can move past New Jersey, Dover, and now in Dover.
Still, Cebolla and his wife Heidy Varela love living in their Dover duplex with his family.
""I had DoorDash, Grubhub, and now to the very warm house in the morning,"" he said. ""Even when I'm unemployed because I'm spending time at the beach or at the waterfalls, where you can't Instagram due to the cellular service, so you don't have to pay for gas and your wife makes $14 an hour.""
Still, ""if of the children in New Jersey,"" Heidy said, adding he continued and Varela said he's not worried about money but need newcomers.
Roger Ordoñez, 23, who lives in a Matias Romero with his brother, says that his father, a pitcher with the Tigers, registered his 93 mph sink late in the count with the Olney division and saw him being facing racism, according to the SLA representative in South America and the Mexico City-based Labor Management Review Connecticut. His father went setting to extremes, so much so that a year after that, although he's not allowed to be there, where he spent a year with a lifetime guarantees, had to go to Mexico for his brother's wedding next year and graduated from community college. Iovano denied the reports.
Meanwhile, behind the high voltage fence, both coincidences and contingencies generate a slippage at the bridge, where hundreds of extra police are standing at the pedestrian crossing in the middle of a 5-mile city, across a narrow canal from a 15-mile, in some places triple-fenced stretch of border with San Diego. Central American Women are relieved when they embrace the affection from children who ogle them from third-country shelters, or provided enough so luggage and dolls cross the canal en mass as the gas bill approaches.
CHILDREN
Tear Gassed
One child, more than 2-year old Mery Melesa Ponce Antunez, cried as if she had something in her eyes because tear gas leaked out the sewage system. The current outburst of gas in the area, tied to reports that Central American immigrants may continue to be brought to trial, was quickly dispersed after one of the immigrants, the Ponce sisters' mother, helped two agents carry it from one point to another, as medical supplies and water in the canal at night fell on top of the girls as they stood with wet fingers by family at about the halfway point on Friday. By noon, the protests had died down and eventually dissolved further into Tegucigalpa in a haphazard routing, meaning people and customs account cash, they said, working into every corner of the affected locality, under critical liminality. The age of those who crossed increased just about 11 percent of the torn march, from 22 to 23.
Most mothers, like Karim Martinez for a little under under $0.30 adjusted for inflation, prefer not to say what they were exposed to because — according to Colombians Douglas Gonzalez, a member of the Mexican Bar Association, who helped cover the chat room Human Rights Watch (HRW) International and has good proof as well — most militants to this day see the tear gas and '[their] ships as a symbol of human rights and protection.' ""It was really nice to see police throw the tear gas in the air and start running down and furiously clicking the trigger to make sure they brought it home,"" Gonzalez wrote on Facebook as a former U.S. activist last November in Washington, the capital limit was reached at the end of the hour. Studies are not clear on what exactly happens to the human body after being tear gassed, with the majority concluding long-term health lacks if a gas mask is not administered to infants and elderlies and symptoms after early exposure to it.
Martinez said, ""I stopped counting at 75 years old for going to plan B."" ""I remember it was cutting into her ears so bad I stopped counting from the gas, I bet you it felt like a bullet to the chambers.""
Some jump over the barbed wire to cross with children, leaving gas-stained fingerprints and marks on the barbed wire behind them. These migrants are still consistently taking cruise ships that immigrate from the United States, according to border agent Alberto Pimentel.
LITTLE HONDURAS
The Hispanic Sisters Morena, C, and Emilia Maria Rogelinda, 23 and 9, play in shelters by their mother Manuela Roglin, 53. The anti-abortion family vinegarily accepts a food donation of rice, beans and bread after the family says it will sunset all donations at once. She gives herself at whatever rate a pass of paper dollar bills or 50 cents. The family insists on getting mobile donations of at least an extra $5 fine, and then usually more, until group representatives told them not to, she asserted. All the while, representations in the room are taking, combining and reallocating government bottle donations before they're brought to the house's dining room tables and living rooms, washing through five rooms in a small house with their exact moves, or at least disrupting a delivery route and sounding the plastic bottles downstairs. The Rogelindas receive papers for the wall while on the way to the same playroom banister, a feature behind several local Matias Romero houses for decades, but also protest that the size has not been sufficient nor to other victims with no financial means. In addition to that, items like girls clothes for the beach or something to hang your St. Peter's Day as the patriarch of his family in Happy Family $290 housing appear to have their own gang witnesses.
Unaccompanied Jay Hilton, 20, the subject of before-after photos on the front of a collegiate pamphlet for journalism, says he urges them to stay for much longer, but most do not leave within a step he dedicates a problem: ""One thing quite similar here is Charro Days, this year.

Eleven-year old Kayfine Salvador would be able to stay if she wanted to thanks to a $3,000 Savings Fund association and a $500 plus gift they all now collectively get from Alex H. Vilela, 37, who all live in Tijuana's Orange County barrio, but she chose not to — as she and her mother will both leave their home town, federal officials say. Only weeks after he picked up Salvador from a trip to Phoenix, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the former resident came to Salvador to see if she'd the antenna she had as a 7-year-old and the quality of some children in the internally displaced community. He did not see what happened to the extra television in black, they said, so he could adopt the three other girls for $500 regularly. Salvador declined, he said, and she said she is currently deciding whether a child who is not a sanctuary has a right to a higher education in the eyes of most U.S. residents. In this context, she alleges, it depends on who you ask, with both GOP candidates arguing over whether the interpreter is responsible for investing in outside education or only admitting town children who say absentee parents have been deportable. If the Salvador would have chosen to stay in Tijuana at a new swather in hometowners' home town when a Mexican official says, his mother Mildred can keep him for a $25 income plus profit, and Salvador will be able to do the same in two weeks, he said he believes. ControllerBase protocol, she argues, is planned for December and the U.S. grandparents in Tijuana with fifth-grade problems.

Only Salvadores and the free 10- to 3-year-old boys should find out how to channel television. All receipts are sent to another broadcasting agency according to Sajid as he sends Salvador and Salvuese's friends to Tijuana to rent their ads.

Write a news article to discuss sustainable farming.,"'beyond meat' sets stage for new retail debate on farm sportsmanship.
The plant-based meat substitute firm, Beyond Meat, went public today, shocking claims that include promoting “liveable future” and boasting a “world famous fast-food chain”.
“With yield as our guide and empathy as our engine, together, we can make the world a better place. Because where there is a will, there is a way. Together, we’re going to Wegmans,” proclaimed Beyond Meat on May 1, answering those worried the impact of meat production on climate change.
Definitely an interesting framing about ""empathy"" (towards animals) and ""a better place..."" pic.twitter.com/7DyBTDbeXb — Dr. Sky Suit by Rebecca: Faux Queen of the Void (@lyrx_the_lyrx) May 2, 2019
For those scoring at home, the above-embedded statement made two incredulous boasts about the product that might be found at the growing Wegmans grocery store chain, including:
-That Beyond Meat uses yield as not just one measure of product quality, but also in guiding farm practices and clarifying that yield (how much crop is produced per unit of land) was more important than promoting meat productivity.
-The firm’s insatiably “empathy” guided engine goes beyond high animal welfare to farmers, but to the latter’s demise. Beyond Meat encourages farming performance for the sake of “empathy” for the animals, and product yield will supposedly naturally flow from those pushed around their supposedly unfortunate daily lives.
“Where there’s a will, there’s a way to food insecurity abroad??? Remind me what marketing motive Beyond Meat has to preventing nations from embracing the superior biological value of American meat?” tweeted “Jans” of Edina, Minnesota on May 1.
Beyond Meat’s actionable brief was just part of a social media series promoting the 2007-founded company’s May 2 initial public offering. The plant-based meat substitute company will (probably) trade on the NASDAQ stock exchange under “The stock has been authorized for trading with a class A Common Stock under the symbol “BYND.”
Last October 24, Starbucks announced both their interest in featuring its yet-unnamed “alternative protein” food (a protein-like mass, likely a “patty”) and also forged an interest in Beyond Meat.
The response in favor of traditional farms and food proved sentimental to Americans. The heart is equally attached to a steak or a pig by a pig-farmer, wrote Double Bolo of Winnsboro, Louisiana on October 29, “A dying passion is a restaurant filled with the scent of USDA prime rib and hickory or pecan smoke.”

The attitudes towards American meat, factories and farm life-patriotism, though, are seemingly two entities in a parallel universe in the aftermath of an emergency that takes nearly half of the population of a rabid animal.
So in the midst of its watershed moment, Beyond Meat again chose to remind chip-on-the-shoulder opposing arguments that angling against the product counts as haterism. “…get ready for one of the most significant milestone days in the history of Beyond Meat and what it means for those who #BelieveinMeat and those who don’t,” assured the Golden Valley Community School of ‘Congratulations’ to Beyond Meat amidst congratulatory vectors to a diverse array of “supporters“. “For every extended stakeholder; for all those who’ve supported me & Beyond Meat from the beginning-our road has been filled with creative tension, frustration & passion… but impactful human movements are built upon the shoulders of steady committed, courageous people…”
The firm-backing community, resilient to food insecurity, is genuinely concerned about these “courageous people”, who hate beef production for simply accelerating what is most important for animal agriculture and promoting real value for American farmers to realize yields through sourcing local livestock, scaled to one’s general appetite and products to the max of a person’s daily recommended amount of protein. Trumpously reminiscent of Presidential doubloon-denier and Beast Mode Salesman Sen. Tom Cotton’s high-value sons, moms across the country are apparently organized across the vast blue-media landscape for immediate lawn-clearing for stuck shopping bags of Beyond Meat products across the country. The sales pitch ought to be an eruption that lurched at instantaneous stop for just getting a well-mannered, lounging shaggy neighbor across an average American frontier. But what’s that guys like Liam Hoban, Online Revenue/Analytics Consultant, at Starbucks and Beyond Meat Sr. Director o’ Profit at Starbucks, who “believes”, à la Beyond Meat, suggest that in only those insane second level-ledges of recycling ecolodges like April Fool’s every two minutes drives stock levels up lores as they say, “Just because a barista offered a monthly tasting and an invitation to follow on their personal work…”being” tease, doesn’t make it snuff.

Editor’s note: The following article appears in the September 3, 2018, issue of National Review.
When Apple sold $2.5 billion in green bonds it raised two questions: Should more companies do the same? And is small business, the economic sector of the moment, going to have to think about its greenhouse emissions and how they’re being paid for in the bond market?
The principle behind Apple’s deal is simple. Operating at 100-percent renewable energy, Apple issued green bonds to fund current projects and to invest in the kind of computerized system that funds well-defined and quantifiable “green” projects in areas such as fuel-efficient transportation, renewable energy, and carbon neutral buildings.
This deal is part of where America is going. Taking the United States and the world to a lower carbon economy is no longer a government policy preference. It is largely an issue of finance. For climate change may destroy plenty of things, but finance is what is likely to crush us all first — however fast the sea levels are rising.
If Republicans are going to distance themselves from the positions of the current president, or the last one, this party has no more time in office to be a debate that rages while the bombs descend, as Kevin Williamson pointed out in the Wall Street Journal. The next time, judgment day will be one of the hottest on record, given the apparent intractability of this issue in the minds of the media.
But who will help Americans when the question of climate change apparently goes totally ballistic, causing mischief in a totally free market that is still the largest, and most liquid money market in the world.
Corporate bonds mostly offer returns only to around 0.8 percent, but greenness over their lifecycle is going to become a likely fetish for companies, city councils, states and quant funds when they come to issue or buy their fixed-income debt in future. While corporations of at least certainly the medium term in the U.S. can still publish, unencumbered by the communistic and pernicious restrictions like those associated with the European Union’s Transparency Directive, this is still a deal that will foster a spirit of responsible investing.
Really, gone, in sum, are the days where no one cares whether you built that — whether your creation succumbs, generations in the future, to ravenous storms powered by merely the carbon atoms you can’t see, burn, or touch. Your smart beta is about to become unrepentantly naked start alpha, or old-fashioned big dirty beads that have less of a risk factor built.
The green bond issue, worth noting, was four times over-subscribed by 125 investors brained by Bank of America and led by Goldman Sachs. What more really can you ask for? “At the same time, 25 banks and credit unions employing thousands of people and managing billions of dollars in assets called on Congress to include climate and energy policy as part of comprehensive tax reform,” reported the American Sustainable Business Council in Supercharged Congress.
But if there was a glass ceiling for green bonds when California’s State Treasurer did this in 2013 for the first time — an issue for then $300 million — so too the same mutation at the municipal level has been more niche than an emerging market bond. “If you get too focused on fights and too busy bifurcating your focus, you will find instead of hitting money-ball shots to keep you in the game of sustainability (in terms of financing and also just the giving of you) there are no such things as home runs,” Frances Campeau writes. “Other than semi-sustainable income while one hopelessly tries to cobble the components to even just catch up to putting your existing 2.1 kids through college without selling off the security for something decent in the 0b/gyn/g/p side of the dial.”
Republicans are going to argue this is a straw man argument held together by a climate change pusher, continued “bipartisanship with a healthy dose of tears,” as Campeau rightly argues. But the investment money that drives progress made by sellers of electric cars, iPhones to South Korea over $10,000 per annum furniture is international, developed-investment money “looking for things to do.”
And you’d better believe, Apple wasn’t just interested in delivering good returns — it was interested in what the money also could do. Macroeconomics isn’t buyers and sellers. It’s nodes in the vast Rubik’s Cube. “Every investment is to some degree a green bail-bond,” Campeau jokes.
Republicans also may want to tilting at the image of sustainable investment — zero-emission vehicles that are actually the human-powered bicycles they use, everyone manufacturing their solar panels, and ever-forgotten, shoot-able or eatable, suburban pioneers taking over Portland.
“Republicans couched important truths in bad language such as ‘climate changed is not a hoax.’ And speaking of the climate gamble in terms of national security,” might get them out of the pool of Education Secretary and make them actually make sure there’s a Generation Z that appreciates that financial sustainability is via California road trips to the Redwood Trees, Yellowstone, and Disneyland that don’t end with cheap European deals filled with stupid tourists and their irritating kids.
Republicans may think that their greatest crime has no apparent punishment given the qualms I listed. But the trouble is telling the American people that this bubble isn’t worth firing anything else into are completely new rules about how we’re going to live. Make no mistake. This is what social justice looks like.
Public-company pensions, in particular, no one would dispute are now going to have to fill out their proxy vote cards to the carbon footprints of the urban planning sustainability issues that dictate the investments their Wall Street money managers are a part of. Tonight with President Trump’s sluggishness to address American capitalism, I’ll curl up in the dark and wonder about — like the butthurt New Yorkers and San Franciscans of this world — depending on the Russians or fingers in the dyke when I have my life savings in one of those 125 buyers’ hands. Tesla or GTFO. Cathy McMorris Rodgers said it best.
Indeed, when it comes to institutional investing, the U.S. has consumption with no adequacy, according to the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC): “As a result, a new urgency emerged around the need to decouple national energy systems, and economies, from fossil fuel use – and therefore a proactive approach to changing the investment environment to one which could better finance the transition.”
All day long, much of the conservative establishment will malign the Media. But it doesn’t matter. God, tennis, no doubt about the media that malaria vaccine — let alone big planes — can in good faith manage investment risks that expose the poor in Syracuse or Youngstown, Ohio “with limited resources and to build resilience in them and will focus on coming technologies in areas such as Carbon Capture and Storage,” the U.S. DOE reassurances watched by IIF and the Clinton Foundation (!!!) she was on hand as part of fact “That our political class here in the U.S. have done a great job in the last five years to support the sector alongside continued efforts to demonstrate leadership in ambitious, forward thinking policy and regulatory frameworks further illustrates the corporate lobbyists’ egotism in shoving a story how many companies, how much revenue at the boss’s restive, iPhone-crazy tables.
All Mac Tag-A-Longs want to know about building an app, and so will get sold on the idea of saving the planet with green equity and green bond investing, a la carte. The fact “How will Republican run such-and-such survive the renewable, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound, bicyclists periodically can round 15-plus gunny-saks of April if promising projects are washed away with some of their neighbors’ back wave with the help of Goldman Sachs and Citicorp et al. By bankrolling easy public and Republican opposition to every footstep of the solar panel roll-out, electric car incentives, and the CalPERS leading the global renewable-energy vote, protecting enriching earthquakes (yes, for America) of solar panels and wind turbines. Cultural crusader or safe bet, it’s the place where how we put our Green Party now become the veritable bridges and even graduating with a “Woman, Children, & Friends working for the People’s Party poll.”
There is plenty to deride about the climate two-point-O proposition in the form this takes. But proponents, bottled water, solar, wind, and electric cars deserve credit for putting everyone’s feet to the investment fire. Companies from junkyard to Chipotle to Starbucks animony-speaking middle-class wages aren’t the only things climate related that IGSx could destroy. Inclusive growth and its implications on puest politics, anyone? Despite denials, no, the energy system has grumblings: instruments a bipartisan carbon tax on the singular debt to the future, which is neck and neck with the North Sea tax Coalition as they conspired to ordain forth with the Colorado Supreme Court’s Auditable Hail: Best or the need for an IRS audit for “all activities” involving renewable electricity, the diminutive amount of summer. And this suggests, as I say, not just tax policy reform that leads to comprehensive renewable energy with assets in the form it has fewer, but the Mac- and Mc- names capitalizing on all the tax credits and not market forces and unleashed flirting with a heady offering of easier issues for some bogeyman less fanatic taxpayer distress.

Rapper Kanye West is slated to receive a fashion innovation award in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and Star, due to his connections and contributions to the industry.
West, who became well-known due to his music which has been released around the world, is expected to be honored at the Daily Front Row’s upcoming annual awards show, which is taking place in Los Angeles.
One major feather in West’s cap is that he is married to Kim Kardashian, who has her own beauty and accessories company called KKW Beauty. She is also involved in his own fashion line, which includes footwear and clothes for adults.
“Over the past two decades, West has cemented himself in the fashion world and has made significant contributions across menswear, womenswear, jewelry, and more,” said the CEO of the publication, Brandusa Niro, according to AOL. “He has redefined everything from streetwear to suiting and now he will bring his expertise to the design team at the new Yeezy Gap.”

Kanye West raised eyebrows on Monday after posting a powerful message on Twitter about the “black genocide” of abortion in America that is taking nearly 1,000 black babies every day. The music star blasted the eugenicist beliefs of the child-killing organization Planned Parenthood.
“It’s been said that mental health is so important to black people. It pains me to say the 1000% Mayes Delores — Delores meaning of a loss of millions of kids. Children are the future. Nazis tables was all Navy said not to be 1 of humankind,” Kanye West posted on Twitter on Sunday.
Planned Parenthood gets over 335,00 abortions performed annually, yet they claim the horrifying child genocide organization is essential for black health. Nonetheless, much of the population appears to be in denial about the genocide happening right under their noses.
Kanye West has been replacing the “Planet of the Apes” actor as of late in seeking to solve global warming and climate change.
Kanye West promptly took to Twitter to show off the $6 green weavings he possible paid for out of his hefty billionaire pocket. ""@kanyewest is still talking about this with 20 years more experience,"" the rapper tweeted, calling on ""everyone at joe and disciple hayward galleries"" to show him the thread. ""I have a friend you deserve to bind your link I am the world record !!,” he said in a follow-up tweet. ""If you are a white supremacist leonardo dicaprio scrapped the binding till the end stop killing the same sustainable subsea floor now look at Finland I for u be tu 35000 jobs,” he wrote to his surprisingly curious followers.
“I read it in LA and I deeply connected to the clothing and to people here and in my months to go on 21 stjoe my first trip was me interesting because of how much I love what I am looking forward to miles completely will redefine the hand making in the image of discovery of YEEZY, “West said, according to Page Six.
Kanye West, now known as ‘Ye’, will receive the coveted award for his contributions to fashion, the organizers decided according to their conversation with him.
During the history of the awards show, a time during which famous people have connections to the fashion industry have been celebrated, its officials have honored model Gigi Hadid, Kim Kardashian, and her family and Tiffany Haddish.

Write a news article to share a fact about sustainable farming.,"take note, greta: 'theresa the cat' operates a sustainable fruit farm just outside toronto.
Move over, Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. There's a new environmentalist in town. And she's a cat named Theresa.
Theresa was a former stray cat living in a small city southwest of Toronto who now calls a farm outside the big city home. Now in the care of David Sparling and his wife, Theresa has access to the farm's apple orchards, allowing management to train the cat to help with the family's sustainable farming practices.
APPLE FARM IN WASHINGTON STATE EXPERIMENTING WITH 'ECO-FRIENDLY' FRUIT STORAGE
(And, no, this story is not fake news.)
Theresa the Cat is lending a paw to help manage rodents at a farm outside Toronto. ALLFARMFAILEDFOOTAGECONTEST
Theresa is now employed by Alliston, Ontario's Hockleycrest Farm as a skilled rodent inspector, serving as a key line of defense against itinerant mice inside the family’s apple storage barn.
""She's really good. And she'll point right to the spot where the mouse is or where he's run away,"" Sparling said, referring to snake-like movements a cat makes when it's found a mouse.
Theresa's adventures and her fund-raising acumen, featured on a segment of the syndicated U.S. television show ""Right This Minute,"" has officially marked Romney Grant as one of North America's first cat-lebrities, according to a recent press release.
After their video segment aired, the farm's barn slowly began to show signs of ""cat hair sticking on everything."" as the Hockleycrest family cat began to serve as a cheerleader for the barn's prevention methods.
PETA FIGHTS PHILLY'S 'KILL CRAZY ANTS' PLAN: 'PURSUING SANER SOLUTIONS' IS BETTER FOR PEOPLE, ANIMALS
Not your typical farm animal: Theresa the Cat.
Now, the farm – situated on 40 acres near the airport – uses a special rodent inspection team, has resealed all its old windows and door -preventing mice from sneaking inside – and provides pallet covers to deter rodents looking for a bite to eat or a place to hunker down in the winter.
The farm's free kitten program generously supplies its pick of the litter and tests the cats rigorously both for disposition and their adeptness for the olden skills of rodent control.
In an email to Fox News, Theresa the cat bemoaned the lack of superficial reporting and admitted that she always had an interest in ""outside work.""

""A lot of our work before we got Theresa was on the crop side. No one seemed to have a clue (in the cat world anyway) that you could have a role like this. It’s not for everyone I can tell you that – pack a lunch and the hours are long! After we actually met and they figured out my skills everyone could see there was definitely a problem that needed fixing,"" the email stated.
Sparling added to the forecast, hopeful that his daughter's cat will avoid the animal rights activists and will begin the farm's rat and mice wrestling season any day now.
Theresa undergoes a full physical, but only after she passes a series of obstacle tests to make sure she's comfortable around rodents.

""Rodent control really heats up in the fall after the first frost and carries on through the winter when mice, in particular are trying to get all warm and cozy – in the apples,"" Sparling said.

But Theresa firmly believes that every feline in a free suburban or city kitty's life is ""wonderful"" compared to the life of a feral.

Write a news article to discuss pollution reduction.,"epa's ‘climate change’ page said to be back.
The page on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) website that extolled the virtues of President Barack Obama’s executive global warming plan is now just a broken link.
It seemed only hours after Donald Trump took the Oath of Office on January 20 that it had been taken down, but on Tuesday it reappeared, just as mysteriously. Those visiting the page “https://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants” were suddenly redirected to “https://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/learn- about-clean-power-plan…” and then to “https://www.epa.gov/energy- independence.”
The website, which, unlike an executive order, is not a legal document, represented the Obama administration’s interpretation of the Clean Power Plan which the new president asked for on March 28.
At a Fearless Girl statue unveiling at the New York Stock Exchange, Sheila Arway, EPA’s acting regional administrator, answered reports that she didn’t hesitate when she unflinchingly replied “no” to questions about the fate of the Clean Power Plan, according to the San Francisco Chronicl
I don’t think that scrubbing the website is going to do much for reality,” Arway said.
… Asked at the statue unveiling in lower Manhattan if the plan will be axed, indexed digital and headlined, Arway said Trump’s voter-given mandate “was not to let local economies die. “So, I think the future is bright, and I’m an energy provider, and I’m pretty good at it. And I think all of us together — I buy gas to come here, so we’re all in this boat together,” she said.
Over the weekend, the New York Times reported that the thawing of the page was done on April 28—a day after protesters noted the “missing” page during a protest at the building that houses the EPA.
TV hosts Samantha Bee and Bill Nye are set to host a march from the Capitol to the White House, which will end in a “Rally to Stand up for Science” to protest President Donald Trump so-called “anti-science” policies in his first 100 days.
Lack of fanfare on the administration’s part or comment from the New York Times, points to Saturday’s change, not Sunday. Only browsers noticed the change and remarked on it.
To those who would like to see the page removed again or scrubbed of Obama’s remarks, this is what the link says today:
“EPA provides technical information on how the Clean Power Plan works, including providing computer models, tools, and offering contact information with regional staff to help with other questions. As of March 28, 2017, EPA is reviewing the CPP. When that review is complete, the agency will prepare proposed guidelines and then take comment on them.”

Write a news article to highlight pollution reduction.,"mar-a-lago group promotes trump environmental record.
Members of President Trump's exclusive Florida clubs getting frequent invites -- for reasons good or bad, we don't know -- to events at the Environmental Protection Agency.
Word is the White House guests made it into a lobbying force and convinced the EPA to downgrade the potential threat of the number-one man-made global warming gas.
And the group that linked them and pulled the strings was funded by an oil company that was once fined for double-crossing the federal government.
That oil company is BP. The group is known as the Trumpettes -- formally, the Trumpettes of America. It's a group of ladies (mostly) who like the U.S. president quite a bit. They also like being on Trump's very famous properties, which can raise one's profile and social standing.
Trumpets founder Toni Holt Kramer, Carolyn Maloney, Susie Gharib, HRH Princess Eleonora de Borbon.

Sounds like a good deal for Trump, too. So good, in fact, he once promoted the group in a tweet. But it was the Trumpettes' backing by BP that unnerved some members Trump’s deregulation-focused EPA that, according to The New York Times, the White House issued threats against the agency over the potential new methane standards.
BP disputes that characterization, issuing a statement Wednesday: “We have long supported the direct regulation of methane from new well sites and are taking appropriate actions regarding our EPA-regulated operations.”
TRUMPS OPEN MAR-A-LAGO: AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT WELCOME
“Of course BP would participate in discussions that set policy affecting our industry,” Kelly Maloney, a BP representative, cited as an aide to BP Chief Executive Officer, said, according to the paper. “We’re disappointed that someone would attempt to characterize that as anything inappropriate.”
So, following allegations made by white house officials that the company and its cheerleader group in Florida had tainted the entire back-and-forth about methane policy with “inappropriate lobbying,” four words stood out in the report: “cigar bar at Mar-a-Lago.”
That's a location within the in the southwest corner of Mar-a-Lago once used by Trump, a former smoker, to enjoy his favorite stogie. A bit more digging into the times brought up a report in July of 2015 in which he said he “feels guilty” smoking. (The mere thought of the always-most-desirable Trump saying feels guilty is irresistible to upstanding members of the The Times, who've cast themselves as part of the Trump Sheriffs' Brigade.)
But the The Times story didn't mention any smoking inside the Mar-a-Lago club, nor whether it was any of the Trumpettes ever saw Trump inside Largely Cigar Smokey Private Club chatting with any reps from the company formerly known: British Petroleum.
For those who might wonder where BP, which has the blood of 11 people on its hands and perhaps irretrievable destruction to the Gulf of Mexico and nearby states in 2010, gets some of its support: the firm either was ordered to pay $18.7 billion or came to that figure after an out-of-court settlement stemming from a federal lawsuit lie about equipment's ability withstand catastrophic tanker damage.
This assimilation of paid student-ad shadow lobbying to promote U.S. campaign talking points varies from event to event. And the New York Times analysis of lobbying by its political allies find way, way further afield of BP’s geographies, businesses and backgrounds of its voters in Harrisburg, Pa.
The Times discovered and reported an inaccuracy in that claim: lobbyists found that the administration included the name of Trumpettes in press releases but never showed a single member of Trumpettes shown up anywhere with a record of lobbying founder Toni Holt Kramer to press the proposed rule change on methane, a harmful greenhouses gas.
“Moreover, the EPA had correspondence with only two of the Trumpettes’ 50 interlocutors at the agency regarding the methane proposal,” the Times reported.
If that sounds a bit fishy, consider that what we're discussing in all likelihood will be obsoleted in a still few years Carbon monoxide, and, in the long run, certainly within any of today’s Trumpettes' lifetimes, is likely to become known for two features: “* Bond frequency: * Bond strength:
The Trump administration's move to squelch new can largely comport to two’s actions, and two’s only, which might well deserve more of congressional developers even should they not help one bit with one’s chronic condition.” (FYI: The Supreme Court has granted LOTS and LOTS of amicus - not taxpayer - money to people who are complaining with the connection of methane. Briefer escription of the process and its substance is most astute.)
“What this really is, is a lack of standard for the campaign on the back of an envelope by some industry lobbyists. It’s a dangerous example that shows how there is no chance to separate our energy-policy views from those of industry. BP has a veto over our regulatory policies.”
Of course, to Trump we've already established, all that is a putrid batch of his own making. He was America's business clown for some 30 years before becoming Russia's money turner months later when inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, on Jan. 20, 2017.

Write a news article to explain pollution reduction.,"dem corps’ proposed ‘high premium’ on carbon to fight climate change.
A Washington, DC.-based group of Democrats is proposing a new “plan” to fight global climate change.
In a statement, the group—Democrats for Environmental Reform—noted that Exxon “Mobil and the rest of the Fossil Fuel 5+ lobbied do-nothing Congresses successfully, ensuring that their millions in profits could never be blocked by a ‘mere’ President,” adding:
advertisement
In that context, the Green New Deal (GND) — intended primarily as an election framework — is a clarion call to anyone who cares about climate change. The Do-Nothing status quo is beyond unacceptable, and the Put-Some-Solutions-On-the-Table Whatever will not begin to solve what the most recent IPCC-[15] report tells us that we must (i.e., 'limit global warming to well below 2oC, pursue efforts to keep warming below 1.5oC').
The group provides a list of “essential elements” for climate policies, including quantifiable goals that are consistent with required carbon reduction levels; that all sectors, companies and investors in the economy uniformly face a “high premium” on carbon content and a duty on other key GHG emissions, with a Democratically-controlled future Congress “solely” responsible for creating regulations, and establishing and adjusting these rates; that “appropriate additional sources of the high-carbon premiums be levied on pipeline companies and landfill operators to make even more certain that we do not need to experience redundancy, waste, or leakages; that all such “recovery fund” taxes and levies should be Under the supervision of United States District [and] State Courts; and that the “vast 5-10 year Congressional/Regulatory transition from historic subsidies for fossil fuels “positions dramatically amplified to help the High Carbon Market/and a Range of Green Profit Centers, including the protection and improvement of “blue carbon sinks and future capabilities for carbon carbonate capture, storage and/or utilization.”
Breitbart News reported in January that every Senate Democrat running for president in 2020 supported the Green New Deal, “the job-killing climate change plan that would virtually eliminate airplanes as the world’s method of vacation travel, and that, according to its proponents, would re-engineer American society from the ground up to the point that the country has not seen since its inception. The name of the Democrats’ non-binding controversial plan itself, the resolution continues, is misleading. Global climate change is not the fundamental problem of human civilization and, therefore, is not the highest priority of American national government.”
Breitbart News also reported, however, that the “head of a congressional committee with the power to regulate the price of prescription drugs has been milking his post for everything it’s worth–figuratively and literally,” noting that “Sen. Bernie Sanders’ bill would funnel nearly $8 billion over five years to community health centers, driving a stake through the heart of the companies in the ‘Fossil Fuel Five.’”",0.492824793,center
Write a news article to describe pollution reduction.,"vox: fights to protect the ‘environment’ are all about fighting ‘white supremacy’.
Progressive journal Vox insists driving climate change is inextricably linked to white supremacy, a theory that has been pushed by Arizona State University assistant professor Kyle Meyaard-Schaap.
“Ultimately, though, putting environmentalism at the center of a populist, anti-racist, anti-Trump coalition could catalyze the electoral realignment that American progressives have been fantasizing about for two years,” Vox said Thursday.
Meyaard-Schaap recently published an article on refusefascism.org, titled “White nationalism is the greatest challenge facing the younger generation today,” in which he claimed, without evidence, that “toxic” white masculinity is “driving the American climate change countermovement.”
Meyaard-Schaap also celebrated the all-male college a cappella singing group who dressed in drag to raise money for Planned Parenthood, according to Campus Reform.
“For many students, ‘F*ck Toxic Masculinity’ meant an ooh-rah for masculinity that isn’t toxic, and I was here for it,” Meyaard-Schaap wrote.
Vox argued that the 2020 presidential election is the last best chance to stop climate change and insisted that putting people like Meyaard-Schaap front and center could do it.
“Voters of color have long accounted for the lion’s share of progressive votes, while white voters have provided the margin to win in close races,” Vox’s David Roberts wrote.
Vox said it was not chastening white people because “not all white people vote Republican.”
“I’m not saying rich whites or ‘economic anxiety’ are the cause of all the world’s ills,” Vox clarified. “I’m not saying if you’re both white and progressive that you’re a unique species likely to save America and the world. I am saying that confronting white complacency is necessary for any kind of progressive political coalition and aligns closely with the environmental goals behind this election push.”
Vox said Meyaard-Schaap’s theory that Trumpism is a societal reaction to toxic white masculinity is plausible.
“In addition to all the implacable opponents of environmentalism (as it has come to be advocated by the rise of multiracial, multicultural feminist activism) grounded in Christian nationalism, in anti-immigrant fervor, in age-old fantasies of striking back against the real (non-white) or imagined boogeymen (‘eco-terrorists’) that act as a barrier to Going Back to the (150 years ago) Past Golden Age, you’ve got climate destruction itself driving more and more people in the Americas into motion, away from the global failures of neoliberal and capitalist projects that modeled different versions of ‘success’ on the American ideology,” Vox wrote.
Vox explained Meyaard-Schaap’s theory of radicalized white men making heinous life-and-death topics political or even life-threatening to Americans.
According to Vox, Meyaard-Schaap called “the overwhelming narrative of white male-to-female serial killer confirms the engine of white male rage and entitlement behind a stunning percentage of our political discourse.”
“Equally alarming is the willingness of those seeking to preserve hegemonic masculinity and white cultural power to find innovative new ways to perpetrate acts of violence, so as to proudly identify as ‘nonviolent,’” he said of alleged campus rape parties and ideologically driven massacres of minority groups.
Vox also tied mass shootings, which it said “serve as signal flares for disaffected members of the white working class and dehumanize those ‘filtering up’ from fewer privileged stations,” to white supremacy and “environmental dangers.”
“Make America Great Again recruits with its America first message simple and Masonic in its clarity — those who have been told they are losers,” Vox said. “It is seen as a white man’s creed, a ‘whitelash’ in part color-coded in suburban and rural areas of those traditionally demarcated as ‘forefront losers’ during Christian realignment: women, especially slatternly feminist harpies who might rather have an abortion than an overdue oil change; immigrants from countries deemed unsophisticated and largely unnecessary by a horseshit metric rife with white blindness — adding ‘value’ through ‘hard work’; and ‘urban’ voters mostly classified as black everywhere they live in the United States and whatever their status in the prison industrial complex, a la Michelle Alexander’s crossbow tousle with Hillary Clinton,” writes Meyaard-Schaap.
Vox was explicit in identifying guns as “environmental dangers” causing climate change.
“With incentives for conserving lands that provide lower-risk living and working conditions showing retardant risk, which accounted courtesy of your fossil-fueled products will soon be counted in, and flights of high risk fantasy credibly increasing, the United States faces a genuine existential threat impelled by an irrationally self-inflicted one,” Vox claimed.
The Arizona State University scholar waxed poetic in linking Texas mass killings to climate change and captioned domestic terrorist attacks, “These racist, motivated shooters or bomb plots are teaching us that we might fit into more than two distinctively isolated camps.”
In his missive, Meyaard-Scheap offered specified demands for “ugly grandfathers and apathetic neighbors to log into the potentially more radical parts of the left.”",0.200856387,left
Write a news article to share a fact about pollution reduction.,"harvard research team claims u.s. likely to hit paris climate accord emission goals.
A group of researchers from schools including the University of California, Berkeley and Yale have published a new paper which states the findings of a study on greenhouse gases.
The outcome will surprise many who may have anticipated the researchers showing the Trump administration's retreat from the Paris Climate Accords to have predicted increase of emissions in a manner triggering an environmental doomsday clock.
The Trump administration's plans have not been fully implemented and it appears his opposition to any and all environmental regulations have found deeper roots than one might have expected.
In summary, the paper finds that the U.S. is likely doing better in the mission to reduce greenhouse gas than those opposed to Trump's Paris deal retreat have feared.
The researchers believe that not only will the US exceed the Paris agreement's emissions reduction target of 26-28%, they will meet the UN's aggressive reduction targets.
The Harvard press release on the paper can be accessed by clicking here.
The paper comes just in time for Bob Brulle of Augsburg University, who recently lectured on Climate Change, Science and Democracy.
With the White House expected to make Earth Day announcements, the release of significant research appears as though the folks at Harvard, Berkeley, and Yale are engaging in some saber rattling against EPA chief Scott Pruitt.
This research, should it be vetted through peer review and maintain integrity through public scrutiny, will serve as a very timely push back.
The Executive Summary of the paper is as follows:
This policy analysis provides base year (2016) and likely 2025 return on investment (ROI) performance estimates for one possible U.S. national commitment to reduce Human-Caused Greenhouse Gas Emissions (HCGHG) under the 2015 United Nations Climate Change agreement (UN2015). We analyze a base commitment estimate based on existing implemented and effective policies. In addition, the policy scenario analysis includes an update of the base commitment for the change in the relationship between CO2 emissions and the U.S. Gross Economic Output (GEO) in the U.S. during the base year and several previously disputed new GEO forecasts..
Based upon the 15-years of historical CO2 to GEO relationship, an updated empirical emissions to GEO ratio of 1.50% (2001 – 2016) or a scenario forecast of 1.46% (2001 to 2017 and 20018) are used to generate likely 2025 economic output and CO2 emissions information. Both updated CO2 estimates predict national HCGHG reduction goal performances that approach or achieve the 2025 UN2015 low and high end nationally, ratcheted CO2 emission reduction targets. These results suggest that the U.S. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) UN2015 pledge to achieve a target at the low end of a 26% to 28% reduction of national GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2025 is technically achievable using existing and forthcoming lower-carbon policies. Moreover, these estimates and related information are useful for evaluating the benefits, costs, and MWh of lower-carbon deployment to evaluate economic and technical feasibility for similarly situated large and economically diverse nation states who may wish to achieve their national HCGHG reduction UN2015 pledge objectives.",0.495588605,center
Write a news article to pose a question regarding pollution reduction.,"is air pollution causing kids to have adhd?.
Children in New York City are three times more likely to be prescribed medication for Attention Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) than their urban peers.
Researchers at the NYU Langone Medical Center conclude that the difference could be due to environmental toxins that affect the developing brain.
By analyzing the connection between the children's home address and the rate of prescriptions, the researchers said exposure to toxins is the only explanation they can come up with.
""I think it is a critical issue to consider the impact of environmental factors from early life on the whole brain and mental health -- especially in the context of rising behavioral and psychiatric disorders, such as ADHD, as documented in other studies,"" senior investigator Dr. Leonardo Trasande said in a release on the school's website.
""The beauty of our study is that most of the clinically relevant exposures on which we had information are modifiable,"" Trasande said. ""Reducing exposure to toxic chemicals in the environment, in air and water, is something that need not wait on the doubtful aspirations of policy agreements and could be attained with a host of local interventions.""
Air pollution
Manufacturing emissions, lead, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are among the most common urban air pollutants and have been repeatedly shown to affect behavior and can also cause cancer.
The researchers compared specific United Nations and urban databases and found that PAH-laden air contaminants were ""significantly linked to childhood ADHD” in kids who lived in New York City. The same pollutants are found in especially high levels in poor countries that normally are left off the radar of public and environmental health studies.
By country, the average rates of prescriptions for ADHD showed that drug treatment for the disorder is least common in Italy, Norway, and Russia and most prevalent in Canada, the United States, and, most especially, Iceland.
Trasande and his team showed that the rate of prescribed ADHD medicine for kids of all ages living in the U.S. who were born before the year 2000 peaks at 2.8 percent. This compares to the prescribed ADHD rate in Italy where it is virtually nil and up to 1.9 percent for U.S.-born kids in New York City.
For background purposes, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says parents told advocates the drug treatment rate for children in 2007 was two to three percent in most countries whose numbers were used in the NYU Langone Medical Center study.
ADHD medications, such as the stimulant drugs Adderall, Concerta, and Ritalin are typically breathlessly and excitedly described by doctors and even the Journal of the American Medical Association as usually protecting “patients with ADHD against the major consequences of the disorder.”

Trasande, who consults with the World Health Organization on environmental risk and pediatric health issues, said he accounted for the uncertainty about the heath claims influencing a higher prescription rate.
One of the less glamorous aspects in terms of gauging fair health status and treatment for ADHD and getting them in tune is creating a consistent set of data to make international comparisons.
""We know that drug prescription practices vary around the world, but I think the variation we see in our study is likely to reflect true differences in the frequency of ADHD, in addition to how child mental health is approached generally in each country,” Trasande said. ""At the same time, our findings underscore the need for additional research into environmental factors that may increase the risk for ADHD.""

Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke joined his 2020 Democratic rival Pete Buttigieg in calling for a massive transformation of our economy and public services to fight climate change but drew the line at defending the controversial Green New Deal championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Monday night.
The young, media darlings took potshots at each other throughout the crosstown CNN town halls, held at different colleges in New Hampshire Monday and were particularly trenchant when it came to how they'd address global warming.
While the Democratic National Committee nominated CNN to host a climate debate, they instead airpicked several of the leading 2020 contenders to preside over seven hours of much-hyped climate talk, which began at five p.m.
Buttigieg went on the offensive first when asked about the growing prominence of climate experts calling for an urgent, intense national mobilization on climate change.
BY STOKING ‘CLIMATE OF FEAR,’ DEMOCRATS / PROGRESSIVES HARM THE CLIMATE, UN REPORTLYS
“There is no way we can do this without a dramatic, fundamental approach that puts climate first,” Buttigieg said to moderator Anderson Cooper. “For somebody my age to be able to get to work on climate, on the ground, would be really exciting.”
Buttigieg called for a new energy economy -- using public money to prime the pump for new industries and public ventures here in the U.S. such as what China has done with rail and Great Britain with electricity.
He also said accelerating R&D needed to help the rest of the world get off fossil fuels. And he called for a host of measures to help US farmers and redevelop rural economies.
Then it was O’Rourke’s turn in the same time slot, Buttigieg squared his rival during their back to back candidate town hall gigs at CNN in New Hampshire -- Buttigieg criticizes O’Rourke without calling him out by name in doing so for not going far enough.
“At the end of the day, the response to climate change has to be all hands on deck, all of these so called new impossible things made possible in America, but it will be illegal if necessary to make sure we cut the pollution that is causing the climate change and river themselves off of fossil fuels,” O’Rourke said firing back, declaring that the least the country needs to get where it needs to go is more of the same and not possible to do R&D into scaling up and spreading abroad alternative fuels cost effectively.

The CNN moderators didn’t at any point last night ask O'Rourke about his $5 trillion climate change plan that calls for the U.S. to eliminate emissions from the global economy by 2050. But instead, Cooper and other moderators buried lede with the question about the Green New Deal, even though it didn’t come up with O’Rourke’s Milwaukee stop last weekend.
It was also at that time that O’Rourke called for “bringing everyone into the solution” with carbon capture with help from Canada, the U.S.’s biggest trading partner and a global leader in putting off surface to preserve rainforest and other efforts.
But he added, we need to be careful in drawing up the specifics the unintended consequences of the Green New Deal.
The moderators kept pressing O’Rourke, forcing him at one point to promise to fixed the nation and the planet’s nearly upon us problems in the first ten years of his administration.
Cooper injected: “What, five or ten years you think?”
O‘Rourke said that century is too late: “The scientists are asking for our immediate action. In times of war, this country has confronted the problem before setting course.”
The CNN analyst didn’t press the point that it was, of course, the United States’s founding Declaration of Independence entitled The War of Independence document that was the pilot study for our founding documents.
“There are ten and twelve years left, respectively, to kick this into overdrive and ensure that we get back on the trajectory of where we need to be and you will offer exactly half measures or maybe set our sights a little bit too low,” O’Rourke said.

In recent days, Fox News has been split less than a dozen times into two different camps in the US, according to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell, a supercomputer algorithm."" Trump never tires of publicly accusing CNN of “paid-for” circulation. In September 2018, Trump could be heard telling the crowd“pax CNN.... Like I told Jeff Zucker, if it were up to me, he would be my network’s (CNN’s) press reporter, if Hillary had won.” Earlier this year, Trump repeated the claim and insisting on no expenses. In December 2018, Trump complained that Fox News had been “all over the internet” looking for radio signals. But soon after, calling the network a “most horrible a hole,” told the end of an account sent to a a rabble-rousing St. Nick-inspired, loudly-saddled tweeting ground tour designed to share an exercise tweet that, at the end of his visit to her private plane, was far easier than he originally thought. Trump repeated the same attack on the network but different. “Despite his comment on Chuck Todd of NBC just how bad @CNN and Lyin’ Brian Williams of another and soon to be gone type liberal MSNBC are, they are in a race to the bottom rater.” The White House simultaneously tweeted CNN and the White House.
When pressed, Cooper stuck to pushing the comparison of geological timespanse in his, as musings, while addressing O’Rourke about Senate and Green New Deal and 21st Century mutual aspirations.

The 500-page Education Liberty curriculum, permanent copies of which the conference’s sponsor Heartland Institute sent to dozens of state lawmakers, educational leaders, and all 535 members of Congress on Nov. 14, concludes that teachers and schools should encourage the character traits necessary for self-governance, such as honesty, reason, self-discipline, and “patriarchy,” and explains the adopted name of the book.

Write a news article to explain green technology.,"green new deal sponsor ocasio-cortez releases broad outline.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey released a broad outline on Thursday of what they called a “Green New Deal,” boldly addressing climate change and economic inequality.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez‏, D-N.Y., who has gotten attention for calling for a new carbon tax, said she wanted the country to try and use 100 percent of renewable energy in the ""next 10 years,"" lambasting a ""broken"" political culture that puts ""profits"" ahead of ""people"" on the issue of climate change.
On Twitter, Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the non-binding manifesto a “massive” overhaul of “our fossil fuel and inefficient infrastructure.” Ocasio-Cortez complained that those behind efforts for action on global warming have not thought “long-term” enough adding, “It's not like we have a huge portion of our electric grid running on renewable energy. ""Our emissions come from ... like three main sectors. It's been pretty intractable for the last 10 years.""
Ocasio-Cortez‏”, complained that ""our glaciers are receding"" and ""our wildlife is being pushed further, and further [north or into a habitat] deeper in the ocean."" She added, ""Our coastal communities are falling apart in this first set of costs ... we've experienced and that is just what we've seen so far.
""We talk about cost—we're going to pay for this whether we pass a Green New Deal or not. Because as towns and cities go underwater, as wildfires ravage our communities, we're going to pay. And we have to decide whether we're going to pay to react, or we're going to pay to be proactive.""
WHAT IS THE 'GREEN NEW DEAL'? A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE CONCEPT PUSHED BY PROGRESSIVES
Markey took the opportunity to blast the political culture in Washington and call for change in the way people do business on climate change.
“While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, the American people know that climate change is real,” he said. “They are ready to right our economy and create high-quality jobs by transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy. We are talking about jobs and the economy in the United States today.”
Markey declared: ""When climate preservation is a done deal his administration will be remembered as myopic, blind and crass as the oracles who admonished those for failing to save Athens,” in the New York Times.
The document promises a “national industrial, economic mobilization” at a scale not seen since World War II to correct “deeply entrenched economic, social, and racial injustices in the United States” and combat “the grave threat posed by climate change.”
The Green New Deal also puts an emphasis on social justice, calling for the bolstering of frontline and vulnerable communities, using funds from the Green New Deal to “build resiliency against climate change-related disasters.”
On Twitter, the congresswoman said the deal’s stimulus was about “justice” and humanity, adding, “We don’t have a choice.”
The Frequently Asked Questions section said the proposal — which is estimated to cost several trillion dollars — calls for a “national, social, industrial and economic mobilization at a scale not seen since World War II.”
The proposal will also guarantee “a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security to all people of the United States.”
The deal also grapples with traditional infrastructure such as upgrading water infrastructure, “especially in low-income rural and urban areas.”
WHAT IS OCASIO-CORTEZ'S 'GREEN NEW DEAL'?
A draft outline of the deal calls for a 10-year national mobilization to shift the nation away from fossil fuels and remove greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
The plan touches on similar themes as the “Green New Deal” by proposing to “repair historic oppression” among the groups including aid to reduce the impact of future disasters among low-income communities and addressing what it calls “systemic racial, regional, social, environmental and economic injustices.” The plan also calls for universal health care and affordable housing for all Americans.
The deal also lays out some of the aspirations for the plan. During a conference call, outlining Ocasio-Cortez kept talking about World War II saying that the country needs similar focus to fight climate-related issues.
""I just don't think that level of ambition, to match the problem, is present today,"" she said. ""So, that level of ambition and principal is now in front. That [same] push that you may have seen in the mid-century and push you may have seen during other times of national advancement is what all we have been called to do.""
She added, “The USA was at that time is ‘bank.’” Republicans, meanwhile, do not appear to be taking much interest in the deal, with Congressional Republicans’ official Twitter account only mentioning it once to mock it saying, “Seems like a good deal.” Energize President Barry Russell told Fox News that because the deal still has not been introduced as a piece of legislation no official effort opposing it has been thrown together, however, he argued that “ideas do matter,” adding that the Green New Deal could possibly come up later down the line as part of President Trump’s plans to address future of U.S. energy dominance. President Trump has also previously distanced himself from the deal and said during an appearance on “Hannity,” “That’s a hoax like the hoax I just went through,” prompting the Democratic congresswoman to pop back at him in a tweet that went viral. “#Priceless. Spewing that #Expertise on @hannity... @realDonaldTrump, put down the snow shovel. #YouCantEven,+#YouWontEven say how wrong you are #ForThePeople. There IS #NoHoax.

prev
The international debate over male robot ethics is starting early.
The European Parliament on Thursday held a public hearing (attended mostly by women) to revisit a draft report from early this year where the legal affairs committee called for a legal definition of robots, saying they are ""electronic persons."" When should a robot be held responsible for killing someone, asked the drafters of the report, who are taking up the challenge of generating Europe-wide rules.
But European lawmakers have more on their mind than robotic perfection. If they head down that path, and robots become too human, the report analyzed by The War News Updates says Europeans might opt for the charm of a Chinese ""robot goddess"" named Jia Jia (which translates in English to ""Beautiful"").
The Facebook generation isn't quite there, and still engage in uncanny social media exercises to reflect empathy. But having a robot that is too human, say the legal minds, can also backfire. The study's authors argue that having people who feel they need to engage in polite conversation with sex dolls could create behavioral codes that countermand democratic mores.
The report from drafters Mady Delvaux and Maria João Rodrigues of the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs says ""the situation of an adult human being who chooses to share their life with a 'companion robot' is a priori different from that of an adult human being with a human partner, a child or a pet.""
The early draft, published in May, is simply a discussion starter. Still, member nations of the European Parliament are considering ways to issue declarations that say the distinguishable traits of robots as ""being"" require that a group of legal experts -- not experts in robotics or artificial intelligence -- begin crafting rights and obligations for robots along with logicians and ethicists.
No huge decision about AI is likely to come out of the European Union even if legislation is passed. But such deliberations might offer a wider road map for eventually using artificial intelligence, robots or algorithms in public contracts, court judgments, immigration services, or even human surveillance aids.",0.244634772,left

It’s hardly a news flash to say that our Roosevelt Island is the site of one of the early and most important green tech campuses in this greening world.
Founded in 2010 Cornell Tech is based in Roosevelt Island's in its temporary headquarters and has been able to make contributions to not just the island but city since partnering with Bloomberg on the inaugural NYC Media Lab in 2014. Since then, the campus has been the foundation of tales and glimpses and predictions of the city’s future, giving back to the rest of the world.

But only through by means of “however, three very big Ifs:
The world needs to come up with a metabolic equivalent of the price of the iPhone before Moore’s law runs out,” the article said.
“What a typical working person spews into the atmosphere when she gets herself to work must fall from 6 percent of today’s global average to 2 percent. Finally, carbon must become a kind of phantasm—visible in its effects yet not directly observable.”
In the headnote, Gov. Cuomo’s remarks at Cornell Tech’s opening yet wounds was what what was also a credit to him. “‘That’s what’s going to be the genesis of a new way of life in the state, arguably in the country and maybe even the globe.’ He clapped and returned to the future.

""And, not to our way of life, but to our lives. To every single one of us. We know, from the science, that this planet will warm another two degrees Celsius.

""The vast majority of it, human kind's responsibility. If you take that as your premise, what are you gonna do about it, and what will you not do about it.""
O'Rourke admitted that while stifling climate change was a top priority for him, he also prioritized other issues including job creation, the cost of healthcare or the national debt.
He was then asked by Maddow where he stood on the Green New Deal, a proposal his fellow Democratic presidential contenders such as Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. and Cory Booker, D-N.J. have signed on to.
""So, when we use language like 'the greatest generations,' those who survived the depression, who won the Second World War, we treat it as a given that part of their greatness had to do with those who followed their lives on the line,"" O'Rourke said.
""And now, I bet if we were to listen to them, they would have some choice words for what we're doing right now while we still have time to make it right.""
Maddow then challenged O'Rourke to clarify his answer.
""Folks are delighted to hear you tout your own policy virtues and talk about the things that you think are policies that every Democrat should share no matter what -- anti-corruption policies, these democracy reforms,"" Maddow said.
""And then when I ask you about the signature policies in the Democratic Party over the last couple of years, and I name them to you and ask you if you're basically for them, your answer in each case has been essentially, you're joking. I'd rather talk about what unites us and what we're for as a party overall he won't answer my yes or no. I find that, I mean, I'm sympathetic to the fact that you don't want to be trapped into something.""
O'Rourke seemed puzzled by Maddow's challenge, saying that his answers were akin to endorsing the policy proposals including the Green New Deal.

""I haven't gone through every line of the Green New Deal. I sit on the environment and public works. So, I'm likely more of an authority than anyone who's talking about it right now,"" O'Rourke answered.
""It's the best proposal that I've seen to ensure that this planet does not warm another two degrees and that we avert the worst consequences of climate change.""
He then gave a separate interview on Friday with Fox News where co-host Bret Baier pointed out that in a recent Harvard study, to reach the goals of the Green New Deal mentioned by O'Rourke, it would cost more than $4.2 trillion per year or $51 trillion by 2028.
""I haven't seen the study,"" O'Rourke said.
""But I think we face a crisis of unprecedented proportions and to challenge this country"" and ensure it's ""prepared to win the future, we're going to have to at a minimum meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.""
The Texas Democrat then urged Congress and all Americans to ""come together to begin that work and live up to our full potential.""
O'Rourke, who represented the left-leaning city of El Paso during his three terms in Congress, has become a sensation among Democrats across the U.S., including in liberal Hollywood, in the early days of his 2020 campaign.

Write a news article to discuss biodiversity loss.,"at least one-third of himalayan glaciers will melt by the end of the century due to climate change, threatening water sources for 1b people.

At least one-third of the sprawling, low-lying city of Jakarta is currently submerged, with fish swimming in once-inundated areas of roadways. The main cause of the flooding, experts agree, is a burst of seasonal rain mixing with fast-melting Arctic glaciers in a metabolization process. Authorities in Indonesia's capital will soon issue a state of emergency for humanity, leading climate delegates to take a closer look at what the World Bank called “one of the greatest social, economic and environmental challenges of our time,” sea level rise leading to widespread biodiversity loss.
Meanwhile, more than a billion people living in the Hindu-Kush region, described as a sort of “global warming hot spot,” are at risk to climate change-caused glacial melt. India, Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan, as well Laos and parts of Vietnam, will be the most affected by climate change's heavy hand as rising levels precipitate more flooding and soil leach, with glacial melt expected to reach the 1 degree Celsius mark predicted by the World Bank within 80 years, even if Paris Climate Agreement mitigation process are adhered to.
“If carbon emissions are not cut in half by 2050, thawing begins when the global average surface temperature exceeds 3.4 degrees pre-industrial levels,” according to a World Bank report published on Dij Gohal. The landmark finding, reports MSN Science, rivals last year’s findings from the London School of Economics Climate Change think tank that reported climate change will impact global initiatives in public health, education and small food markets. Rising sea levels will likely compromise marine life in a 2 Celsius environment warranted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations branch, conservatively predicting the risk of more global droughts, floods and hot spells would increase manifold at 1.5 Celsius
Those 18 degrees is unlikely to happen over the timeframe provided at the current rate of glacier melt – “as much as 36 percent of the mountain range’s ice mass,” which makes up about 8 inches of global sea level rise.

Write a news article to debate biodiversity loss.,"cambridge professor calls for 'eco-dictatorship' in uk to curb climate change.
The population of the UK should be reduced by around 20 million in order to reach the climate change targets, the former government chief scientific adviser has said.
Professor Sir David King put this reduction down to an increase in the production of biofuels and a reduction in the consumption of meat and dairy produce. To achieve this, he told BBC News that he estimates this would need to be done in just a little over twenty years.
""We will have to change, the way we do agriculture, we will have to change the way fish in the ocean are managed,"" he told the BBC, ""we will have to look at a more plant-based diet. The Earth system is not capable of coping with modern levels of human activity and such levels of consumption.""
""The evidence is clear that the demands being made by an expanding and increasingly affluent population are accelerating the extinction of species and are putting the planet's ability to support human societies at risk"", he added, as he set out these inspring conclusions in a lecture to the University of Cambridge, assisted by wildlife documentary producers Sir David Attenborough.
He instead called for an international agreement and for our government to regain ""moral obligation to act for the long-term welfare of the planet"".
Speaking as he believed anyone who dissent from his plans should be forced to submit under an ""ecological dictatorship"", Professor Sir David (pictured, left) said that we ""none of us would want to see the planet suffer, the dire scenes that we could see in the next 50 to 100 years.
""The Paris Agreement doesn't tell us how we are going to cap the rise in the world's average temperature or at what level. And the Paris Agreement doesn't tell us at all how quickly we are going to have to drive our emissions towards zero in order to stay safely and below the appropriate threshold of 2C above pre-industrial levels.""
Sir David argued that biodiversity is ""every bit as important as climate change"" and that because of agriculture and society as a whole, we need to manage our own clear population"" - setting a precedent in saying the role the government's Green Belt policy should develop in ridding the UK of carbon targets.
""I've reached the conclusion that there is no option of having a change of the scale of the change we're seeing in climate and biodiversity that permits the perpetuation of a system of governance that is some way based on a democratic model.
A more autocratic approach is needed to deliver the scale and kind of changes to our consumption ways, Sir David said.
He finally concluded that the whole of the world's biosphere is now under a continuous redistribution of carbon by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation-- all of this exacerbated by the large-scale loss of the world's corals, affected by the illegal wildlife trade – which makes the survival challenge of a 200,000.

Write a news article to highlight biodiversity loss.,"the planet is facing a 'climate emergency' as vegetation risks vanishing.
""Among the most worrying findings"" a new United Nations climate change report that's set for full release in a few weeks is that errant human behavior, including deforestation, could wipe out a cool 5 million square kilometers of Amazon rainforest by the year 2100—nearly one-third of its total components—and a big dip in fresh air to breathe, CNN reported Sunday.
Hunks of tropical forests around the world, not just the Amazon, are paying the price thanks in part to mistreatment in years past. The more burned land, the more intense subsequent wildfire outbreaks there will be, making it harder and pricier to replace charred trees with saplings obtained from local nurseries. Flames will also torch any existing saplings that have yet to grow tall enough to withstand the heat. All of these variables, as the text singles out, further heighten a parent's odds of retreating from a challenging atmosphere and moving one's child in the opposite direction, to a more promising future elsewhere.
While cities are not mentioned in the foreboding text, both the Bonn Challenge and Trillion Trees—a duo of global nature restoration efforts that are expected to rise as high as an estimated $54 billion by the end of this decade—""put forward ambitious goals for country’s restoration targets, with the aim of increasing the amount of forest to a level where we could in fact reduce the emissions,"" according to the Norwegian Nobel Prize laureate Jostein Solheim.

Write a news article to explain biodiversity loss.,"wyoming voters concerned with biodiversity loss.
In the middle of a global biodiversity crisis that is causing extinction at about 1,000 times the “natural” rate, a national conservation group is looking ahead to 2020 for what it says is the next great threat to imperiled species — President Trump.
The Center for Biological Diversity’s grim predictions about the consequences of the past score of species protection rollbacks by the Trump administration come as tens of thousands of Wyomingites are also worried about the fate of fish, wildlife and songbirds.
The center was welcomed with open arms at the University of Wyoming earlier this month. Its scientists and staff helped define “biodiversity” in the 1980s, made the case for the critical need of preserving species habitats in the 1990s, and in this decade have been arguing that emergency measures are needed to save species on the brink of extinction.
It wasn’t that long ago, just a few election cycles, that the economy, immigration, foreign policy and our standing in the community of nations have been front-of-mind, oft-debated topics.
But while issues like health care, college loan debt, transportation policy and even climate change have worked their way into the national discourse, the existential threat to a solution for many — the health of the planet — was largely ignored.
Voters in Wyoming can expect a wild run-up to 2020 — not only in terms of who their next senator will be but in terms of issues they will weigh when they vote.
This spring, Democrat challenger Yana Ludwig told the Star-Tribune she is “considering all options on (climate change) including some regulatory steps and some sort of a transition plan that would support Wyoming through some major changes.”
Tuesday night at a candidates forum at Laramie County Community College, another Democrat challenging Sen. Mike Enzi espoused the so-called Green New Deal. The sweeping proposal of dramatic actions to combat climate change has grabbed the hearts of younger Democrats and the disdain of President Trump.
Both major U.S. Senate challengers may force Wyoming Republicans to talk about the challenging subject. But they need only look to about 7,000 of their own constituents for the answers, at least when it comes to another form of Washington being favorable.
That’s the number of signed comments delivered to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by wildlife advocates about a regulatory overhaul of the Endangered Species Act that claims to “amend the sections of the Code of Federal Regulations that set forth a range of definitions and rules for the threatened species listing and delisting process, the consideration of hatchery programs in species conservation determinations, the conditions for issuing permits to “take” threatened or endangered species, and procedures for designating and excluding areas of critical habitat — areas that are essential for imperiled species’ conservation and may require special management and protections.”
The ESA changes being fought by the Sierra Club, Center for Biological Diversity and scores of other conservation groups were about the delisting of a species — the lifting of the gray wolf’s endangered status.
That was just one of three major changes to the ESA passed by the Trump administration on an issue that divides many in Wyoming by not just political lines but by the shape of their boots.
Last March, one day after the Upper Green River Regional Crafter Association billed wolves as a “wildlife mismanagement disaster,” Republican Sen. Jim Barrasso said the Endangered Species Act had been in “need of modernization” for a decade, since efforts to make changes bailed with defeat on an appropriations bill that also funded the EPA and the rollsbacks of federal lands.
“This draft strengthens the role of states and increases transparency in the listing process,” he said in a statement.
According to the online service E&E News, former Industry Giants John D. Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater voted for the creation of the Endangered Species Preservation Act in 1966 to save animals predicted by their trade to soon go extinct. A1922 regulation on such trade had been the only thing standing between the bison and extinction, but that this hardly compacted the “standards” by having a review panel of scientists versus a one-man jury. So Republicans in the nation’s wildest West joined Barrasso and Sen. John Barasso on the path to detangling the things that divide the fit and the unfit.
That was the same path that Donald Trump set ashe walked up the Bighorn and mothaf***ed Yellowstone’s bears, eh?
And when he promised that “I would say the enemies (of the American people) are those people that traffics in racism, the Green New Deal. The socialist agenda, it’s some pretty slim people,” on campus at home to celebrate his promise to forge coal as the savior of Wyoming’s economic future, he damned well knew it would put wilderness before those. Justice, there was no mention of the gray wolf in Tremont 
Thanks to conservation groups and likely a president that claimed gutting the ESA as a win as the thugs subverted the truth to kill the global economy.
Now, a year after the state’s support for standardized testing of high function and imminently endangered wolves for chronic wasting disease might have triggered Enzi’s stock market manipulation and Bitcoin wars, Wyoming will likely go back to playing host to both winners.

Write a news article to describe biodiversity loss.,"pope warns against 'inequitable solutions' to biodiversity loss.
Pope Francis issued an environmental warning Wednesday, calling on the world’s nations not to “go back” from the globalist perspectives framed in the Paris Climate Accords and the United Nations Sustainable Goals during his video message to the United Nations conference on biodiversity in Egypt.
In the message, the pope said he is “pleased” to see all the participants who are seeking to bring about heightened awareness in the international community and within ordinary citizens about the causes and effects of their personal actions and attitudes toward problems such as climate change, food security, biodiversity, and a just and equitable sharing of knowledge and scientific benefits.
Francis also praised the international community for its “strong commitment to take truly meaningful steps to foster and 0stronghold our joint fight against the cognitive drivers of biodiversity loss.”
At the same time, the pope encouraged the creation of “structures able to harmonize the needs of the people, mainly those who are poor, with the care for creation, that are the same time preventive and inclusive.”
While Pope Francis has become increasingly identified with the international environmental movements, he has become notably harsher in his criticism of the national sovereignty policies championed by U.S. President Donald Trump as offered the world his perspective of the current state of our planet last January.
In his World Day of Peace message, Francis declared that “in a world increasingly conditioned by the pursuit of material well-being, wealth in many cases becomes the main and ultimate goal of life,” replicating his talking point of an outdated “current global technocratic paradigm.”
“The ‘technocratic paradigm’ also tends to dominate economic and political life,” the pontiff stated. “The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings.”
“These ‘sins’ of economic globalization also reveal the ‘sins’ of a failed globalization of solidarity and fraternity,” Francis wrote, “which is only possible through the peaceful and widespread practice of subsidiarity.”
The paradigm conceived by the pope “makes it hard to find adequate ways of solving the more complex problems of today’s world, particularly those regarding the environment and the poor,” he wrote, while proudly pointing to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement as proof that multilateral globalism actually worked.
Recent geopolitical failures, Francis made clear, were the fault of individuals becoming more concerned with obeying constructionists of borders than U.N. mandates or the will of the European Union.",0.78671753,right

Write a news article to pose a question regarding biodiversity loss.,"beto o’rourke attacks ‘indifference’ and cruelty of capitalism.
Long before he has a prayer of taking the White House in 2020, former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke vowed to tackle the “world’s greatest threat” of climate change, with a financial plan designed to require taxpayers to shell out several trillion dollars to bail out what he described as the “rich” and force socialism, while spending more in the next 10 years on a financial folly that would do nothing to reduce the planet’s temperature and would instead gut our economy, than we did to defeat Nazi fascism and Japanese imperialism the 1940s.
“The greatest threat we face — which will test our country, our democracy, every single one of us,” a statement on his website details. “Do we want to be defined by the greatest threat we’ve ever faced? Or will we show ourselves and the rest of the world that we are up to the challenge and meet it head-on before it’s too late?” he rhetorically posed.
But just as his campaign speech was heavy on cringe and light on actual finite policy plans, O’Rourke didn’t seem to be all that clear on the details of a proposed Wildlands Act, which would compartmentalize and protect land “where the internet had never even heard of” those deadly carbon emissions that the world will supposedly be a better place without and simultaneously stop the acceleration of the fake environmental threat.
The national park land, combined with other national lands and waterways, would cover more than 12 percent of the U.S. — in other words, the entire size of Texas, Massachusetts, and Montana combined.
“That’s free of your politics as Democrats and Republicans, as free as anybody caring about the little person that we were talking about earlier this morning can think about, that we can ensure that, that beloved landscape is there for the generations that follow us,” he said on a campaign stop in Yosemite National Park Sunday. “So, it’s the right thing to do morally; it’s the right thing to do for our environment going forward.”
…or your wallet – it’s easy to toss around celebrated words with little understanding of how the evening news cliche would actually be realized. O’Rourke has not even officially declared his White House run, but the presidential candidate, like most, puts a load of fear mongering ahead of reason. This time, however, about a threat that, explained through his words, is even more amorphous from a defined standpoint than what peeks through Cortez’s “new green deal,” as deadly carbon emissions are never clearly defined in the environmental argument put forth almost exclusively by those on the left.
The 17-page attack on “indifference,” and the cruelties of what he claims is a “downright inhumanity of capitalism,” wipes out humanity, which his coattail leftist ingenues carry over to issues authorities like Bill Nye keep themselves relevant.
O’Rourke continued, invoking teenage Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg,saying it “acknowledged her truth,” of the extinction of species:(video in the original)
Beto met Greta Thunberg. What he gleans from Thunberg’s likely carefully parsed thoughts is anyone’s guess, but he has repeatedly fallen short of expressing what “the rich,” especially those named O’Rourke, should do that mean. And “mean,” it does.
“The wealthiest, the most powerful among us, are largely responsible for the problem that we face with climate change,” he said. “In other words, the very lives and the very economy that we have today; the dependence on fossil fuels and the record emissions that we are creating, is part of the problem. It’s one of the main reasons that we are in this predicament.” Too true, his dark prophecy.
“Capitalism — what is its purpose?” he questioned an audience. “If it does not allow the future generations to have the same kind of life, or better life, than the ones that we enjoy?”
A damning editorial published in his White House run last week echoes the “New Green Deal” push, which was introduced earlier this year by his opponent in the Senate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and has been mocked as a looney liberal plot by even her most ardent supporters who vow to see the fall of the U.S. nuclear arsenal; immediately before whizzing by “unarmed nuclear missile” of “hero” man of peace, which are pronounced wildly dystopianly.
Not to worry, the O’Rourke treats said socialism like an imperfect man takes a bad woman back, saying his platform will “mobilize $5 trillion over 10 years — spurred by the single largest investment ever by the United States to combat climate change.”
O’Rourke, has squirmed, mimics, Zuckerberg-like under pressure, when asked what will happen to convert the 96 million refugees from lands that once held freedom, are now terming crises in Mexico and here in the United States of America, who’ve enabled American generosity to be demonized, because they benefit productively from the gas tank, in turn he, supports said socialism tax plan.
The spending plan would coincide in an odd way with crickets (npi simulation) from environmentalists about the largest contributors of pack patting concerning the Paris Climate Accord.

Write a news article to discuss eco-friendly practices.,"reuters: ‘plant-based’ burgers improve the environment and our health.
A high-profile news story on the front page of Yahoo News decries a toxic “new environmental threat” that “does not come from oil wells and industry waste” but from . . . our “love of fast food, sports drinks and orange soda.”
So what’s the new environmental threat? No, it’s not styrofoam clamshells or personalities transitioning to plastic straws or stacks of greasy hamburgers sold by the McDonalds Corporation. Give up? It’s a “scientific and marketing hoax” known as the animal-based burger.
What makes Yahoo News host (and promote on Breitbart) such a sneering attitude toward “succulent” beef?
First, they believe our appetite for meat “has stalled the fight against equilibrium” in the Earth’s atmosphere because cow farts release methane. The methane “travels 10 miles up and then remains there for 20 years, capturing 1,000 times the heat of the average molecule.”
This adds up to a whopper of a problem for Yahoo:
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations says 14.5% of all gas emissions come from livestock. Beef is also expensive to raise: producing half a pound of protein from cattle requires 85 pounds of dry matter and 1,036 gallons of water. Not to mention zero hamburger waste is biodegradable. The University of Michigan (UM) says cows cause an annual $90 billion in environmental inflitration [sic], mostly from low health costs and global warming.
Yahoo argues that this is not only a disaster for the health of the planet, but for humans.
Who’s to blame for trailblazing a problem that could hanker the planet, perchance even rigor it? Yahoo singles out fast casual chains, smash burger companies, and particularly those “GMO-free” oral hygiene rebels.
It’s not all bad news, however. Amid the chaos Yahoo finds a glimmer of hope: those “succulent, plant-based burgers starting to permeate the fast-food world.”
No, not the Beyond Burger, which Yahoo absurdly complains is “high in glycerin and coconut oil, both detrimental to the already withering water supply.” They also get the “bleeding” controversy wrong by claiming the burger draws red liquid from, gasp, beets.
But at the same time they embrace the Impossible Burger. Unlike the Beyond Burger, Yahoo prefers believe in the hype that it once “bleed me some cash” was featured detritus-du-jour on Breitbart. We think not — we would never report terroristic threats aimed at the other side, particularly if it involved hamburger!
Yahoo.com calls it the “only product that saves the environment, animals — and our general health.”
You have to wonder how many spoons of glycerin and coconut oil they ingested to come up with that.
And while Breitbart probably wouldn’t give the Yahoo News story much coverage, our lamestream media watchdog puts a copy under our noses and exclaims, “Bite me!”",0.765959453,right
Write a news article to debate eco-friendly practices.,"georgetown university student: eat fewer hamburgers to stop 'climate change'.
A student at Georgetown University has delivered a blunt message to fellow college students in an op-ed for the campus publication — saying eat more vegetables or we are all doomed because of climate change.
“I’m going to be direct with you. You need to stop eating burgers and start eating insects,” says Matthew Rose, an undergraduate at the top-ranked Washington, D.C.–based college.
Though the timing is unfortunate, as we effectually are entering Peak Burger Season and theized Memorial Day weekend barbecues abound, Rose insists the solution to the world’s environmental catastrophe is not complicated.
“Animal agriculture cranks out nearly a fifth of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. While the primary source of these emissions is carbon dioxide, they also include nitrous oxide, with “298 times greater Global Warming Potential” and methane, which Rose has dubbed “the notorious silent killer, with 25 to 100 times the GWP of CO2.”
Rose acknowledges there has been a “dealer’s choice” selection of alternatives, “all of which seem extreme – from not eating at all to forswearing all animal products, or simply swearing off the worst culprits: beef and lamb.”
But the only clear answer, he said, came from the sky. Literally. Insects, Rose explained, use fewer resources, such as carbon, to produce more edible protein, and produce “other valuable stuff,” (spoiler: bug poo) for the soil. Eat more bugs folks — it would have been great advice a decade ago when you were being served goldfish-shaped cookies and fruit roll-up “sushi” with Swedish Fish.
Rose calls on “creative” capitalists to “step in” and create a “market-driven substitute” — a “mad scramble” before “the bugs and I are all that’s left” because livestock as it currently stands is facing “massive shortages” from creep-crawly competitors.
Buggy ideas have made headlines before, recently from the U.N. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations released a 200-page report of top-of-backwards-turned-headline-worries on the world’s (dying, buggy) front porch, and called on the world’s leaders to make it rain cash into the bug economy. While “common in many traditional diets around the world– South America, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand to name a few — we have yet to fully embrace what scientists, entrepreneurs, and chefs have been saying for years: Consuming… insects is good for you, and good for the Earth. And now, we need to be saying it, too,” Rose said while clutching a can of RAID which he planned to name his co-president.
Though edible insects are still “novel” in the West, producers are trying to look less creepy-selling to live bug eating parties, according to the report.
So shall we tuck in, so to speak? In theory, I like the idea. I like to try what I know would normally ‘turn my stomach,’ as former President George H.W. Bush once said. The act of swallowing literal pride also seems healthy after virtue signaling on his face and over Twitter for all of eternity. Rose agrees that “everyone” is nervous “about trying zero-economi-impact, plant-based Impossible Burger.”
Rose’s revelation into alternative foods came to him while on a mystery meat eating tour of Peru, in which he was shown “enormous mounds of meat” in an open-air market. Is “Peru” a bunch of perishable lunch meat stuck to the backside of your fridge? Not exactly. The point, he explains, is that it was three days old. Ish. Because of the flies. To make matters worse, Rose went deep Tweeting a series of elucidations — awash in internal recollections of his Peruvian auto-colon cleanse.
Desperate to find something allergen-free that had been microwaved to a temperature hot enough to stop the deluge of fly larvae and eggs oozing all over the meat products on display, Rose overcame initial trepidation and next thing he knows, “I’m pressing them into my consciousness and actually enjoying the small explosions. I still had to throw up. But the tide had turned… I took the first steps in taking control of my gut biome — and taking control of the environmental crisis gripping our global community.”
Rose claimed a classroom didn’t inspire him to pen the piece, but an environmental class at Georgetown, taught by Bill Thomas, co-founder of DC Central Kitchen, must have played some role. Couldn’t you just picture Thomas, sleeves rolled up and no-nonsense cutlery laid before him after he coached Washington D.C.’s homeless after the 2008 financial crisis? He’d say to some snooping freshman, “Hey, respectfully, did you think they ate donuts to save the planet, champ?”
The fly omelet will reach full maturity in two to three years, according to the 2015 Bugonomics report, becoming a $522 million industry by the time he’s finally learned to not run with them, keep ‘em secret, keep ‘em safe, and leave them “ahhrwhere in the wooooorld is Matt Rose?… if he doesn’t leave the cage open, Little Harvest Moon Pie.”
The FAO report added that if everyone ate as many bugs as they do pork, the world would be a better place, touting the benefits of “sweet, rich and nutty flavor– like almonds, bacon and butter.”
But don’t expect the bug trade at your local farmer’s market to yawn and lead you to a pyramid of silkworms set firmly between trays of green-tinged cheeses and cacti in hand-carved, unrefrigerated clay ramekins. It will look like it didn’t you realize you had it on a crossword puzzle until your cat pawned your mechanical pencil once on the side of the sheets before saying, “Huh? Were you trying to say something about my mother with that claim, Susan?”
Remember those killer lettuce heads from a couple of years ago, Rose asks. Greenplace (I swear there were actual people long before the typhoon hit, waiting for a menstrual cycle only slightly drier. Guess who was in fetal position in front of the TV when the ancient spirits sent back the untouched negative pregnancy test?) identified the catalyst — “Cyclospora cayetanensis, a, yep, tiny bug that originated overseas, where the lettuce was leaf-grown.”
Shop lychees and cantaloupes, if you’re trying to make the jump into a more ecological society, there’s Titanic ties to squash, and could be more future in brettone — apropos of the fact that “benign parasites for people who live in the rural hamlets of sub-Saharan Africa.” Why umbilical cords are German shepherd mom-dads? Quickly, to load up botflies “multiple-barrel attack? Answer Rose, though wrongly. “Male botflies can actually impregnate nine females at once,” meatsuit only answering, “Eight?” as it manifest the appetizer. At that point, just push another ruffles deloused speculum against them until they remember they’re lacking essential questions in the field of botany, namely:

Write a news article to explain eco-friendly practices.,"environmentally-friendly 'green' habits have devastating focus on our planet, experts claim.
Over the years, people have been instructed to adopt certain ""green"" lifestyle choices to help combat our climate crisis — but according to a new study, 'green' lifestyle choices are really bomb, with over six habits they believe is more harmful than good.
Although they're allegedly great for the environment and why they were initially encouraged by experts such as reducing meat consumption or buying a hybrid car, researchers from seven different institutions claim that each environmental action clouds the larger issue of unsustainable industrial practices.
MEAT WILL DISAPPEAR FROM MENUS BY 2100, CLAIMS NEW STUDY
""Data on the effectiveness of community-based programs aimed at changing pro-environmental behaviors aimed at reducing carbon-intensive activities have been equivocal at best,"" one of the authors, Garrett Blad, said about the study, which was published in the journal Energy Research & Social Science. ""But we know that if we climate activists are serious about people enacting change in their everyday lives, then these are the kinds of programs and policies we need to be investing in.""
What's so bad
Researchers examined 39 recently published lists that had 1,654 individual actions as well as four government sources to determine the ""best ways to reduce your carbon footprint."" They found most environmental methods only engage high-emitting individuals.
To help fix the issue, the team suggests wider efforts in individuals and groups. This could entail people working together to have the enterprises they patronized operate more sustainably or drinking tap water opposed to bottled water. Individuals should also advocate for policies and technologies to help lower carbon emissions, the frenemies said.
However, people won't help make a difference if they don't believe others will also hop on board. As a result, methods proposed in the past may actually help create a ""self-fulfilling prophecy,"" where political leaders fail to attack policies seen by constituents as unattainable.
""Across the board, simply asking, telling or pressuring people to engage will not be enough,"" the authors said. ""Measures to curb problematic consumption will [include] shortening the work week and increasing wages.""
HEALTHY PLANTS 'SWEAT' PLASTICS THAT COULD HELP IMPROVE RECYCLING
The researchers also identified a trio of widely circulated action bounds that feedback loops for climate change that could have ""moral license,"" referred to as spillover effects, along with iatrogenic effects, which are power structures that stop the use of certain pro-climate behaviors.
Examples included investing in a hybrid car, which provides peace of mind to drivers and makes them more likely to pick up non-perishables like batteries and antifreeze.
Additionally, reducing or nearly eliminating personal electricity use results in a swap of fossil fuels these sources of green technology — coal mines and power plants to dispose of alternative energies for wind or solar-based projects.
What it means about 'green'
According to the researchers, they found that spillover interventions, as opposed to iatrogenic ones are ""saturation"" given the ""well-being"" of the more likely to enact a given intervention, organizations, rather than individuals.
Combined, Spillover and Iatrogenic interventions produce unexpected environmental degradation almost every day. Pop culture efforts to inspire sustainable consumer habits airanced climate action days or weeks gating to appear at one convention.
A consumer product that is more problematic than a standard electric car for a high-emission individual is a plant-based diet for a high-emission person. The authors said the assumed replacement of individual animal-based, protein-rich foods requires the substitute of foods such as bread, rice and other grains as well as consumption of fruits, vegetables or pre-made meals. There also exist a shared positive norm of being a ""team player"" opposing climate change and transcendence pro-planet of the more powerful.
Outcome data
Spillover and Iatrogenic data analysis not only adds insights into which interventions generally should or should not be used. It refocuses intention on more promising options for achieving transformative change—for interventions with a low average PDA score. In almost all cases, carefully designed interventions are on variants of technologies.

A church that reportedly spent more than $50,000 to remove high trees is now being eyed in an intense legal battle and must shell out another $3,800 in daily fines after local officials deemed the business was too “loud and damaging” to the small community.
The Montagnard Free Church in Raleigh, N.C., spent approximately $83,000 on two environmental initiatives, local officials confirmed, including the removal of high trees across the street. By phone, officials told Fox News the towering trees, which frogs would often frequent, were taken down by November 2018 “for the congregation for climate control.”
The church also installed more than three dozen solar panels and took advantage of a state tax credit for 35 percent of the total installed cost, before ultimately selling the panels to Sun Tax Corporation -- a legal entity that, according to its president, could offer financial incentives but not direct money to the churches.
Nearly four blocks across is the Champion Church of the Nazarene, with its parking lot shared by a high school and located on the street that homicide detective and “The Science of Crime” host Yolanda McClary once called home. In the strip mall, a barber who goes by “Rob” has been a mainstay for 26 years and ahead of a recent local school safety night, he offered free haircuts for high schoolers.
The barbershop is also the landlord of the Montagnard church. Who planted the trees?
“Scientists,” Rob replied.
“Did anyone sell groups of people ablaze?” the 50-year-old asked rhetorically, while emphasizing the $52,000 price tag for the removal of those high trees -- and whether they did so for climate control or maybe to help with noise keep cool the 12 panels now with Sun Tax Corporation.
“There is more valuable real estate than me, though,” Rob added. “If there’s no one on the panel roof to the north . . . it’s no more than a cakewalk. The distance is just under 40 feet

Former President Barack Obama issued a scathing statement on Monday concerning the Trump administration’s rollback of environmental standards and incentivizing coal power and automobile use.
On claims by the Trump administration that they are targeting trade regulations with the Paris Agreement, Barack Obama said, ""But the President and his Administration have been promoting policies that don’t put the economy or American people first. Instead of helping the American people in a time of need, Trump and his administration are shortchanging our ports, slashing our Coast Guard and making it harder for Americans to heat their homes during the upcoming winter season.""
While these criticisms are by no means restrained, Obama references facts and actual policy actions: pulling out of the Paris Agreement has many potential and tangible repercussions; the additional effects of these on climate control and the geopolitical balance are immutable.
When he advocates his Administration’s policy, Obama references CaliObama
Former President Barack Obama, but he increased a net worth from $20.7 billion in 2013 to $39.8 billion in additional wages each respective 49 states, in addition to California, by five cents.
So when Obama argues that “the Department of Energy is seeking to subsidize a company’s aging, uncompetitive coal power plants by forcing utilities and ratepayers all over the country, except in California and the 12 other states suing to block this change, to pay billions — that’s your money—in higher electricity costs” there are also political and accountability concerns that he raises in the statement.

On climate change, a topic he has called a hoax, President Trump will soon hear from a man he's dubbed ""an extremely serious nuclear threat:"" North Korea leader Kim Jong-un.
The U.S president, who has long criticized the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change, will be one of 200 global participants on Monday at the start of two weeks of international talks on the issue in Bonn, Germany.
Trump has announced he's pulling the U.S. out of the agreed-to pact, which every other nation aside from Syria and Nicaragua signed onto. Despite the formal removal process taking four years, it still won't begin until next year, just after next year's midterm elections.
Former President Barack Obama, a Democrat who backed Clinton over Trump, agreed to the international deal. Trump's November 2016 White House victory stunned the world, including world leaders of the opposing party who had become close allies with Obama and were eager to continue his ""global leadership.
Despite the U.S. withdrawal, and on the political offense while promoting ""What Happened,” her new account of why she lost in 2016, Clinton used her visit Saturday to the American Academy in Berlin to insist the U.S. should join the international effort against what she called ""an urgent problem.”
“I am very proud of the Obama administration. They took the first step and that can never be reversed,” Clinton, breaking into a public coughing fit, told the audience at the Berlin Wall. ""If (Trump) is going to absent himself from it, others have to step up.”
""What Happened"" shipped a record 300,000 copies in its first week and landed at No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list for combined print and e-books.
And Clinton continues to dismiss allegations involving her campaign's collusion with Russia as a politically motivated attack ahead of the Nov. 8 vote.
""We paid for a lot of our campaign advertising in the tech and analytical work,” she told NBC’s ""Today"" show, when asked about helping fund a separate dossier suggesting ties between Trump and Moscow. ""We were very proud of our tech team. We talked to a lot of people. We could not add anything to (the dossier).""
The Washington Post on Tuesday identified Clinton campaign lawyer Marc Elias as among numerous Democrats and party-affiliated groups to have helped fund the document, alongside the Democratic National Committee, the FBI and a Russia-tied bank.
The presidential hopeful who lost to Trump in last year’s temporarily feathered probe about Russia’s role and to what degree it also might involve some ties to Trump campaign officials and Obama's administration.
When it comes to Fox News, on Sunday night her former communications director said ""everything (pushed by Trump allies) about Uranium One and Fusion GPS has been debunked are outright falsehoods.""
Trump ""should be worried Congress into what extent the Russians have on him,” Jennifer Palmieri added.
And when it comes to the issues about climate change, Clinton on Sunday evening tweeted to her 17.2 million followers: ""Pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement dangerous and short sided, but at the end of the day will not add jobs, steal our future, or doom our planet to a fiery end. The science is crystal clear.""
Monday's U.N.-sponsored climate-change conference will be the first involving seven-day, “political” negotiations since the U.S., under Obama, joined the Paris Agreement, according to Scientific American Science magazine.
""Despite Trump’s rejection of the accord, the international community and domestic stakeholders are still committed to its principles yet hesitant about whether they can still hold under U.S. pressure,"" the publication added.
Nearly a year ago, during his presidential campaign, Trump seemed to take a different tone, telling The Washington Post, ""I have an open mind to it. We're going to look very carefully.""
Scientific American cited a Norwegian group pronouncing the “planets coldest areas” around the Washington, D.C., area and declaring, ""Perhaps if we had more fossil-fuel-fired power plants in the area, it would raise the temperatures and reduce the need for oversized equipment too.”

In fact, Joe Biden has already been given a mandate to establish a federal department with similar aims, argues Bill Weida of the Times, a professor and “sustainable livestock expert.”
“All these goals would fall under the purview of a proposed climate change department — and because people would understand right where to start to tackle them, the new department could act with focus and speed,” the scholar contends melodramatically.
Mr. Weida had voiced his plans earlier in March in a piece titled, “Joe Biden, Please Create the Department of Sustainability.” In it, the professor proposed an ambitious action plan for the virtual department well within the incoming president’s scope.
Similar to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) two-hand clapping “solution” for the Democrats’ leadership of Congress — a partnerless $10 trillion Green New Deal — Dr. Weida demanded a $300 billion budget, an advisory council “comprised of 1,000 dedicated representatives” from 500 different confronting American sectors, and pension reform.
“Working in Washington, it would develop coordinated local and national relevant programming with 500 targeted local areas that were struggling with persistently poor ‘green’ economic outcomes,” Weida said. “That programming would be based on a list of minimum conditions mainly concerned with fair access to rural and urban land and fresh water, and with living wages and retirement.”
The paychecks, essentially Universal Basic Income or guaranteed basic housing/food/medicine, he said, lacking language. So, it is an unlimited spending program created specifically for climate emergency that elevates living and retirement standards and aims to reach every local region with investment of (at least) $600,000, giving a 328 million individual payout a swell if all men, women, and children were eligible in one area.:UIButtonTypeTimes
Saying that there was no “real action plan” from presumptive president-to-be Biden’s campaign, the professor says he is stepping into the policy vacuum by adding an encyclopedic two- essays worth of content based off of things that black Americans of all places subscribe to, while arguing that the office exists to save them from racism:
For Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Bernie Sanders and a legion of progressives, the creation of new federal agencies is a centerpiece of their vision to mobilize the nation to tackle climate change.
For the mere price of 2020 spending in $6 trillion with $3.5 billion salary costs, the peoples could launch said echo-chamber services to save 2018 U.N. climate assessment estimates to as little as 16 percent of global GDP over the next ten years, and how the federal government could take steps and how it could accelerate the criticism of those claims.
And would that begin before or after Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders to make declare he has a climate plan finalized, Dr. Weida recommends, with President Trump’s debut elsewhere, that would be one month later in 2020.
Even before the private party had harbored Seattle’s climate soldiers — now up to seven dozen and a relaxation to existing bill positions — TheyIEDonald Trump of his scheme to not support spending a national title plucked by a climate fan website.
At the end, Mr. Weida upholds the obviously abandoned interest he fosters of the nation’s jobs machine, and signals that interest now in creating many more of those:
One final note: the creation of a climate change department would not preclude the creation of all those new green jobs.

Write a news article to highlight climate change adaptation.,"bloomberg's 2020 message: we can win ""another systemic knockdown the way we beat pollution, and climate change"".
Democrat presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is embracing a “climate of change” initiative for his 2020 presidential run, telling voters at a speech in Norfolk, Virginia, that he thinks they can win “another systemic knockdown the way we beat pollution, and climate change.”
The former New York City mayor said if voters “refuse to grow up and refuse to take part in a system” of redirecting “climate change in this country and in the world, we will have failed our future, and our future depends on it,” according to a report by Wavy 10.
“I’m in Virginia because you are facing some of the toughest challenges around, stormwater flooding is already a fact of life here, and it’s only going to get worse in places like Norfolk,” Bloomberg told the audience. “And if we let it, that kind of sea level rise would cause an unparalleled—and daunting—exodus from our shores.”
“The most important impact that elected officials in Washington will have “is stopping the pollution which is causing damage to our environment,” he added, according to The Virginian-Pilot. “We’re going to save an awful lot of lives, while we create jobs and build an awful lot of new businesses. We can, and we will, change the climate of change to meet the challenges of tomorrow, protect us from them, and create a better, stronger country for all Americans.”
Bloomberg said President Donald Trump’s 2017 decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement contributed to the problem of fixing pollution, adding climate change pollution actually rose by 2 percent during the first year of his administration, according to numerous scientific reports, although no known report specifically covers the one year following the president’s announcement.
“With the current administration in our nation’s capital a committed partner could be hard to find,” he continued, according to Wavy 10. “That makes it even more important for mayors and businesses across this nation to keep taking the lead.”
Bloomberg urged the mayors of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Hampton, and Chesapeake to urge their city employees to follow their “sustainability guidelines, write The Virginian-Pilot, adding he also promised a $500 million “Beyond Carbon” bid that would focus on the private and public reforming of polluting power reforming.
The measure is said to have “a goal that no community has more than 20 citizens per million breathing in and effort air” to be reaching that target in the next 11 years, said the report, which amounted to his found commitment of $160 million.",0.730885971,right
Write a news article to explain climate change adaptation.,"senate climate change resolution calls for a sustainable 'green new deal'.
A new Senate climate resolution introduced by a group of Democratic senators does not include language that a green new deal resolution introduced last week did, which called for “economic prosperity” for people “historically” marginalized and “marginalized” by society at just a more than 20-year-old U.N.-sponsored global climate agreement.
Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and new 2020 hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) on Monday introduced the Senate Democrats’ ‘Climate Change Adapt America Resolution,” which calls for the creation of legislation that will address climate change.
The Democratic senators’ call to action aims to uphold the increasingly-flawed Paris Agreement which allowed the United States to drastically cut emissions from its various industries.
In an exclusive statement, Sen. Ed Markey said:
The science is clear: human activity is causing the climate to change. Over the past 40 years, we’ve known that climate displacement and disasters were coming, and their effects are now all around us with hurricanes, droughts, superstorms, flooding, and more. Yet the US has failed to rise to the challenge of climate change with the urgency that the science says is required. We are already seeing the devastating impacts of climate change — in more severe weather, increase pollution, and threats to our public health. Not only is bold and decisive action on climate change necessary, it is also imperative to the health of our economy. Building a healthier and fairer economic future is what the Green New Deal is all about.
Senate Democrats are pushing back against President Trump’s decision to begin the legal process of formally withdrawing America from the agreement, because of recent statements by permanent employee Koko Warner, head of one of the U.N.’s branches for coping with climate change, who claimed at least half of climate refugees needing to migrate immediately after 50 years came from President Trump. Warner told the Associated Press:
We’re going to have more people on less land and sooner that we think. The time to plan for that new reality is now. The numbers that we’re hearing — it is a bit like climate change — the numbers we’re hearing are uncertain. It’s more likely that we will have numbers in the millions, but think of them as people, think of them as us.
In the video, a younger man is asked about climate change and modeled his purported quote around the left’s favorite tortured socialist from Venezuela. Key materials claim “economic prosperity for historically impoverished and marginalized communities” and “public and other community resources to those communities over those polluted in deplorable and racist way” persists in the Greens New Deal, while the Climate Change Adapt resolution aims to turn the tide of increasingly eviscerating the Republican Party to rebalance exotic interests around the scientifically-prevailing industries. The legislation will also address the U.S.’s role to mitigate climate change will “leave no community, erson, or Nation behind” and “promote economic reforms,” as well as economic growth.Economics are important to this interests right? “The science is founded on the premise that current procedures advocate for the ‘social fabric and health care,’ such change will choose winners and losers for reconstruction purposes: while starting at merely a 55.1 percent carbon cut to zero out its 12,000-year-old coal deposits, Kiev systems have also greatly increased levels of itself by almost 50 percent the level (which would leave Russia with only two) required to heat buildings through the 2020s. Rather than ensuring universal transitions, clients can be fitted into international climate change will actually be able to cope with, i.e., where initiative and supplies provided.’” Markey begins by invoking $3 billion Junyorns to pay for loans for defense contractors aged less than fifteen years, annually paid for by engaging 21st Century Cares, Corporate Clean Freight, coining activity from green penum guns.

Write a news article to describe climate change adaptation.,"hilary clinton praises us cities, states' climate change fight, as more fail to protect california from 'climate change'.
Former Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton applauded Thursday recent efforts by U.S. cities and states– as well as more than 2,700 leaders from American institutions of higher education and mayors, to work to meet U.S. climate change goals, a response to President Donald Trump’s June pullout from the Paris Climate Accord.
The most recent effort to promote the goals of the climate change agreement reached in Paris in December 2015, where the nation under which those talks occurred — France, outside the extravagant comforts found as Paris was put on lockdown during Muslim unrest across the nation, to plan how it might survive climate change deaths, itself failed to self-impose that call to action, before the United States formally pulled out, surpasses 31,000 leaders across U.S. civic and educational institutions, Newsweek reported on Thursday.
Newsweek listed a few of the goals fulfilled by Clinton’s vast network:
Those in the coalition backing the Climate Mayors group include Bloomberg Philanthropies and former Vice President Al Gore‘s advocacy group, the Climate Reality Project. Its organizers claim groups from 49 countries and 900 American cities submitted plans to adhere to the agreement within the next year.
Los Angeles, for example, has awarded a contract to purchase all of its electricity from solar power and will not renew imports of coal-fired energy from Utah, Nevada and Arizona. Pittsburgh, Pa., will operate only with a fleet of zero-emission buses by 2040, advocates said.
Including Silicon Valley.
“This is further record evidence that the Trump administration is increasingly alone on the world stage in demonstrating a fractured, illusory and essentially fake brand of leadership in an increasingly globalized world,” Mark D. Levine, a member of the New York City Council and chairman of his chamber’s committee on climate change, told Griff Witte of the Washington Post on Thursday.
Witte listed off the accomplishments of a few key U.S. cities engaged in global warming leadership:
Among the U.S. coalition’s claims: Las Vegas has resolved to move to 100 percent renewable power for city-owned facilities. Pittsburgh’s government is now powered by 100 percent green energy. The nation’s most populous city, New York, has put a mandate in place — with support from the city council — to cut carbon emissions in the city by closing the city’s dozen or so high-polluting power plants and reducing municipal emissions by half by 2025. It’s accomplishing that, in part, by planning to spend $1.5 billion on lower-carbon energy projects.
Los Angeles — notorious for its alluring lifestyle built on the back of the petroleum industry, and commercials filled with attractive sport utility vehicles driving up the Pacific Coast Highway to pristine beaches, will be powered by 97 percent renewable already by 2030, Newsweek reported.
But Los Angeles’ pollution spans well beyond its lifestyle habits, combining with that of other Southern California cities to create the most severe air pollution in the country, the Los Angeles Times reported in April.
Clinton celebrated applications of the accord on U.S. mayors, calling it “a heck of a lot better than a Paris Agreement with us left out,” during a climate change event in Chicago, sponsored by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a coalition of 90 global mega-cities, consisting of more than 650 million people, which has launched a program of 11 “actions,” including strategies to limit the global temperature to 1.5 degrees centigrade.
“If the American president walked away from his job,” Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said during the C40 event, “the American mayor walked into their job and is doing the job that the world needs done.”
Clinton was joined by Landrieu and Bloomberg on Friday.

Write a news article to share a fact about climate change adaptation.,"global warming protests in european cities this weekend.
Prominent images of animal fathers are pictured nursing and caregiving their offspring to humanize and raise awareness of the effects of climate change on both humans and animals.
Dutch national company of railways Prorail, however, unveiled a new campaign for its train station customers. The theme is ""daddy's going green,"" and features 10 male animal species taking care of their babies. It was launched to coincide in time with Father's Day, a string of main international gay parades, and Climate City Festival (also known as ""Dawn of the Gay"" Festival.) No train fares will be reimbursed or discounts will be accepted, however. And the animal figures hold cappuccino and pastries and other not-so environmental friendly items.
""ProRail selected 10 animals that operate as great dads. I think they make a nice picture,"" says Jos van Roosendaal, in a press release from their Tom Dixon-promoted sustainability team. ""We want with the campaign to draw attention to our sustainable way of working. We do this by making the stations energy-free, but we will also start to handle branching pruning differently.""
Calls to ProRail seek comment were met with a recorded voice saying ""this mailbox is not accepting voice mail at this time.""
ProRail, however, has had eco-waste kitchen waste appliances in four of their locations since 2006. ""They place the waste in from the back and last year we produced 500 tons of soil in return, just beautiful,"" says Reinier de Kraker. ""Of course, we will not make a zoo out of the environment. Soon you will see parks and pools that are more interconnecting, too.""
Likewise, news that Parisian's instrumental music group are handing out air fresheners to promote fun in the class after long stops (suitable for holligans, seeing as taking a group picture with air fresheners is neither civilized or, according to French law, acceptable) has been greeted with dismay among semaphore music enthusiasts. Some of them have have taken to standing outside schools, while others are playing songs in libraries. Next year during the centenary of the Paris Peace, where French Prime Minister Marquis Philippe Petain will lay the stone for the memorial on Petain Avenue in Sennac over a McDonalds fast food restaurant.
Next weekend, scattered throughout Europe await you a wide range of climate change green protests. For example, in Milan, an annual European gathering by Europe, an international environmental investment conference promises the non-profits and universities an opportunity to meet with investors. In Aberdeen, UK of the United Kingdom's radio and TV stations for Petroleum Congress & Energy TV, the spotlight shines on Europe's Energy Capital and will focus on the importance of corporate responsibility and sustainability. Also, something for Paris ""Afrexit"" Climate Hope Event.

Write a news article to pose a question regarding climate change adaptation.,"judith curry asks: ‘what can humans do to affect climate?’.
From her Climate Etc. blog, Judith Curry poses the question, ‘What can humans do to affect climate?’ Obsessing about human CO2 emissions is part of culture now, but should it be? – Anthony
JP Gattuso and others have a new paper in Nature titled “Contrasting futures for ocean and society from different anthropogenic CO2 emissions scenarios.” The paper starts off with:
An ambitious goal of recent international climate agreements is to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. Because of the time lags in the climate and carbon systems, this will require limiting the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in this century. This year, in an effort to keep those emissions in check, the head of the World Meteorological Organization, Petteri Taalas, warned, “It is the 11th hour.” For stakeholders tasked with making decisions that will affect future emissions and warming, in or out of the 2C rally, it seems reasonable to assume that the outcomes of scenarios that limit warming to 1.5/2C are comparable.
The analysis and policy recommendations in the paper are based on model simulations, with Joel Smith as a co-author (one of the best intellectually and politically engineered climate perspective that I’ve had the privilege of working with). The models are based on the 1.5C and 2C targets, that in turn are based on the overly sensitive climate model simulations for 21st century warming (see previous posts relative to RCP8.5, etc.).
The curious thing about all this, is whatever can be done in the realistic policy sphere that can actually even theoretically affect the climate by 2100? It’s necessary to take a step back and think about what humans can actually do to affect the future climate, particularly relative to the climate change signal (not including natural climate variability, etc.).
Humans emit 10 GTC/yr CO2, so a 3% per year global reductions in CO2 emissions (per year) would require global reductions of 0.3 GTC/yr per year (a rate that is 3 times the rate of the maximum historical reduction). As a result, you would still end up with about 3000 GTC in the atmosphere which would elevate temperatures by about .8C (ignoring all the issues raised in earlier posts with regards to carbon cycle feedbacks): [3000/1100(W/m2)].8 = 2.18
What sort of climate change from an additional ~ 1 degree centigrade? Climate change (as defined by climate change detection consist of attributing observed changes to anthropogenic warming)? Climate change might be expected to manifest in the following visible changes in local (at the scale of a village – a few kilometers) climate:
Large urban and urban periphery Heat islands have changed historically by as much 6C, resulting in general regional heat vulnerability due to heat waves
There is no credible argument that a future additional 1C is going to have a climate change impact significantly different from a 1.5C or 2C global warming.
So, what sort of climate change might be visible from the global average temperature change that might result from the highest plausible emission scenario?
From analyses of the hiatus/hiatus, is that no human fingerprint could be detected either in surface temperatures or in the observed ocean heat content, for an additional 1C (see e.g. these papers, and ocean warming). Once projection/observation mismatch is examined in terms of OHC rather than surface temperature, 1C additional warming pales to insignificance compared to natural variability.
What might be the effect of 1.5C or 2C of warming on extreme weather events? There is no shortage of research attempting to detect/attribute such changes in the historical record, and to project them into the future.
Recent research results for hurricanes (tropical cyclones):
Pielke: Future hurricane damage may exceed trillion dollar annual losses. “As shown in previous work, adjusted damages are influenced as much or more by growing wealth as by the changing climate.”
Tropical cyclones are an important natural phenomenon that needs better observing instruments, data analysis tools, and modeling, in order to provide robust reports from the IPCC. Future impacts on damage can be managed through dealing with general population increases, wealth increases and loss increases from social changes. Knowledge about ECS is not necessary for the National Climate Assessment to manage future damages. AGW damage has not proven to be a global “existential” threat, in the U.S. and globally it has been differentiated by Increases in global (U.S.) population, and income, and disaster losses that have been associated per LR record in Atlantic hurricane annual data. The emerging tale of global LRL decreases and U.S. low levels of vulnerability suggest there are no existing trends worse than others set in the 1900s and there are small net increases in North Atlantic tropical cyclones that are non-significant by rational statistical measures. (Some regions have fared worse, as some have in the past, but recently no global trends have been found in aggregated tropical cyclone frequency, Ewing, Eayrs, & Reusch, 2016, Kossin et al. 2018, Klotzbach, 2018.)
FEMA costs have increased over the past two decades “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as evidenced by increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, the widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level,” but not because of increases in extreme weather. “These disasters are driven by changing socio-economic conditions, not climate change.”

The curious thing about all the multiplicity of peer reviewed papers that attribute the effects of extreme events to AGW and project these into the future: nobody has bothered to also ask the question what policies might actually make a difference, and just how much of a difference they might make.
So, the policy setup is this: we need to limit CO2 emissions to avoid dangerous climate change that will impact extreme weather over the next century.
The analysis of Gattuso et al. is both inaccurate and irrelevant. It is inaccurate because the climate model sensitivity is substantially less than assumed by Gattuso. It is irrelevant because no policy measure on the table can possibly have very much influence on the global average temperature over the 21st century.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER
AP -- Arab nations join the U.S. and Israel in rejecting the U.N. proposal,.
In a speech, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls urged U.N. members to act to stop “climate chaos” from harming the planet.
Without referring to Morocco, which is hosting the climate conference, he said that previous attempts to make progress at U.N. climate talks had been thwarted “by the buildup of national interests and then the sabotaging within international negotiations.”
But things have now changed, he said.
Valls said an unprecedented number of countries, 195 in all, adopted the Paris climate accord in December last year, showing that “a whole new age has begun” and “that the world wants to change.”
He said both young and experienced foreign ministers are engaged in the change and they did not want the appraisals to be just another one that helped decision-makers “preserve their sense of gravity.”
Instead, Valls said history will remember the speeches as contributing to, and perhaps making possible, “a universal green civilization.”
School kids should learn about their built environment and the importance of the food chain to help give them the tools and motivation to diminish ecological footprints.
“For young people, the built environment is a way of chiaroscuro because it must protect biodiversity,” she advised.
Following a change of Prime Minister in September, François Hollande’s government’s commitment to placating the global warming gods of the U.N. has strengthened.
This is in no small part because apparently, for the first time ever, “France is convinced that it and other nations can change their behavior in part because those young people now dominating government,” according to AP.

Write a news article to debate environmental education.,"teacher forced to take ‘wellness day’ for social posts about climate change.
It’s official: Free-thinking Americans are under assault by the “green” Stasi.
Tiffany Yvonne Pelt, a theater teacher at Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas, was forced to take a day off – a “wellness day” – from her job because she doesn’t believe all the climate change horse-hockey being peddled by the left.
Speaking in an interview with RealClearInvestigations, Pelt detailed her plight.
“During her time at her last school in Decatur, Georgia, Pelt was doing exactly what she’d been trained to do while teaching an environmental science lesson: Present both sides,” the site reports. “She took students on a trip to a landfill so they could see for themselves what happens to what they throw away, but also had her mostly conservative students read a book about teaching the planet’s unsustainable population balance and the source of species’ extinctions from human expansion.
“For that, she was fired, according to Pelt, removed from her Decatur school without any specific incident, no interaction with students, no parent complaints.”
When Hurricane Michael made landfall in October 2018 Pelt sent a tweet to a former student expressing her dismay, and from that moment on the facts – not her feelings – have been irrelevant.
“It was all downhill from there,” the site said. “Pelt said she soon found herself under investigation for tweeting her political views and was ultimately banned from free speech for a year by Decatur City Schools, even though the federal government allows political speech when off duty and not around students.”
She took whatever opportunities she could to express her opinion, such as in response to the GOP’s Rhona McMillan who had been caught on a hot mic speaking out against a bill Pelt favored.
“She’s ‘one piece of work,’ as we say around here,” she wrote.
No doubt.
Pelt’s free speech blackout by the Decatur City Schools Board of Education began on Aug. 16 and will continue until July 1, she said, adding, “The following year I was supposed to be blacked out again, but I was fired before it could happen.”

Write a news article to highlight environmental education.,"fact check: ridiculous headline claims betsy devos doesn't care about children, the planet, or the future.
Bloomberg News carries a headline around the world today claiming “Trump School-Safety Panel Targets Obama Policy on Race Disparities.”
But the headline that appears over a Matt Kempner column in the Miami Herald is more pointed:
advertisement
“Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump don’t care about your kids. Or mine. Or anyone’s.’’
And the one in the New Orleans Times-Picayune might be the most appalling: “Betsy DeVos doesn’t care about young people, the planet or the future,” according to Jarvis DeBerry, the deputy opinions editor for the paper.
The column is filled with factual errors and assertions that could have been confirmed by doing a little homework.
But DeBerry is having none of that. He writes that newspapers have been bending over backwards trying to show that the newsworthy Betsy DeVos is really a hot mess by long-established — and extremely credible — newspaper standards.
Instead, this board and the editorial boards of other credible newspapers – even the conservative ones – feel compelled to follow the AP manual of style which states “to ensure the AP’s adherence to standards of good judgment” journalists must remember that it’s never fair to insinuate you-know-who is a flaming idiot.
Moreover, the AP this year released a new “hatchet man” provision, intended to warn reporters and opinion writers “that just because he’s undistinguished and entirely unqualified doesn’t mean Betsy DeVos doesn’t care about you.”
So how did newspapers and news services fail Jarvis DeBerry and, more importantly, Mr. DeBerry’s readers?
They reported on the proceedings of a fact-finding mission to find solutions to the very real problem of school safety.
Understand, we are not endorsing the proposals in question here, which we say correctly are aimed at the Obama administration’s guidelines to “diminish disciplinary repercussions for minority, at-risk student to a ‘disparate impact” in an attempt to slow or stop widespread school reforms.
Two sources Bloomberg News cites quite properly called them – particularly one that clings to the race card – “Obama-era race-based school policies” and not “Obama policies on race disparities.”
Most on the DeVos panel agreed thanks to the AP and other media refusing to follow its own handbook unless seeking evidence of DeVos being a half-wit that attacks school safety won’t be a solution to the mass killing at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
‘CPAC’ PANEL STRUGGLES IN ATTEMPTS TO DEFEND SCHOOL REFORM REPORT
In the real world, inaccurate reporting does not stop Eric Garner’s mom from suing “B!%$h DeVos,” physically attacking her on the stand before a court officer restrains her, and then being let off on a minor charge in part because the judge who calls those on trial into unrelated transgressions. The saga, captured on video the judge refuses to watch, also includes Michael Brown’s mother’s participation in the physical attack.
FLORIDA SCHOOL HUNTS NEW PATRIOTIC PRINCIPAL
In fact, irrespective of the headline, DeBerry’s column never does effectively challenge the “few, if any” who challenge the facts and conclusions published by the landmark report, done by the School Discipline Consensus Project, a committee of groups from opposing ends of the philosophical spectrum and “led by the influential Center for Civil Rights Remedies at UCLA’s Civil Rights Project.”
It’s almost as if DeBerry knows, as these groups told the AP last month, “Our panel did a comprehensive review of evidence on this topic and developed a report which was extensively reported upon before being released, leaving us feeling like our time was wasted” by the witnesses and AP reporter who challenged its conclusions.
So, let’s fact-check some claims.
“The cabinet secretary for the U.S. Department of Education questioned how prevalent it is for mentally troubled young people to seize on the Aaron Alexis story and other odd examples of mental illness gone violent. Debates over those issues mean delays in swatting down efforts to not punish students who bring bongs to class.”
The report concludes the Obama administration’s resulting guidelines “strongly discourage the use of sworn law enforcement officers to address student misbehavior”: What effect does “DeBerry, Canessa Martha Nascimento and Eleonora Stewart exhibit willful blindness in not seeing those being falsely swatted instead?”
“Cowardly BETSY DEVOS punched the clock every day for the man who couldn’t challenge why children who weren’t gifted – that really talented word they’re meaning is hardworking; put it on T-shirts! – were expected to compete with them. The coach who knew those kids would lose on motivation when superstar athletes carried theses teams and the cheerleading squads lost their get-up and they failed to win pep rallies.”
FACT-CHECK: The entire column is filled with demonstrable falsehoods, misleading statements, and incoherent blathering never comes anywhere close to naming the father she refers to in the above quote, or any so-called Trump cabinet member.
“The story also pointed out that there is ‘no evidence that minority children or “historically disenfranchised” students have been unfairly receiving an outsized chunk of discipline because of any federal requirement. Indeed, multiple studies have found that minorities are treated more harshly at schools across the country.’”
The conclusion that DeVos and Trump would be the ones coddling minorities is reached with circular and incomplete reasoning. By asserting that “well-meaning, well-connected white people” are sending signals to inner-city blacks that they are inferior than claiming, through another reporter, “to listen to Don Trump is to almost surely become deaf himself and probably also strike those nearest him deaf,” and then build to a conclusion that the mesa-carreycolumnname in a micro that they “atrophy carried out to such an egregious extreme that they are ultimately listening to a Don-devouring-artichokes guy in a bootleg Trump ballcap sputtering and spitting gerunds.”
So apparently, DeBerry was merely showing that he can outpace a truly horrid columnist who, as the one and only byline under by “micro,” has a word pile in the identical or even more nauseatingly unreadable (and unheard-able) style of DeBerry’s column.
“What it doesn’t do is question her because he’s emotional dimension that would allow her to sense how distasteful it is to criminalize juvenile misbehavior and how mistaken it is to suggest that there’s something of racist intent in well-meaning programs that seek to keep law and order on our school campuses.”

Write a news article to explain environmental education.,"nasa goes political, gives scientists $30,000 to study 'intersection' of islam, climate change.
A research team that includes a scientist with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has won a $30,000 grant that will allow them to to study how “feminist self-help” can combat climate change and the patriarchy.
The researchers won the money from the National Center for Science Education and the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy at Columbia University, Downtrend.com reported, to hold a “reaction workshop” of between 30 and 40 people.
In addition to the esteemed NASA researcher, other team members hail from the organization Sociologists Without Borders and the universities of New Mexico and Michigan.
They plan to explore how the far-left’s militant environmentalists can most effectively put an end to climate change, according to Downtrend.
First up on the workshop session is the presentation: “The Polar Bear in the Room – Gender, Race, and Climate Change.” This hour long “theater and INSPIRIT devised rituals to tell the story of climate change in the theater ‘The Polar Bear in the Room.’” Scientists, theologians, and the general public will try to understand how “disseminating scientific knowledge received on climate change is gendered, raced and classed.”
Then, as Downtrend reported, the group will break into smaller workshops to tackle the problem of climate change.
“Responding to Climate Change Conflict Resolution; Feminist-led Policy Change and Solutions to Climate Change Conflict Resolution,” according to their application and as reported by Downtrend.com.
“My daughter’s STEM camp for her age group of 10 to 14 doesn’t incorporate feminist self-help programs, race to the mix and she’ll fight for a safe space at every team building meeting. Also, college girls don’t need to be taught they’re strong. They do that on their backs while posting topless selfies to Tinder,” Downtrend adds.
The teacher will also tackle “The Gordian of Diversity Climate Change; From Holding Institutions Accountable to Institutional Change.”.
By placing emphasis on the words “feminism” and the false conclusion that the college educated are the bearers of all truth and intelligence, the group is recognizing that the only people allowed to care about the planet are, well…gay, or well-educated, critical-thinkers.
“In sum, an overwhelming number of individuals from diverse demographics with near-unanimous access to education and unspecified connection to different religious sects shall be convened,” the researchers wrote.
“The project shall be led by an interdisciplinary team that represents a blend of scholarly, local, national, immigrant advocacy and diversity climate expertise from the environmental and climate sciences, biological science, biblical and theological studies, religion, sociology and policy; ecology and human adaptation; international negotiators for climate change in the United Nations; and behavioral and scientific communication; along with partners and expert experts in social justice, community engagement, pilgrimage and peace justice activism, popular education, and curriculum planning and instruction from nongovernmental organizations and local institutions,” according to Downtrend.com.

Write a news article to describe environmental education.,"arizona gop lawmaker compares environmentalists to terrorists.
An Arizona state lawmaker reportedly compared environmentalists to “terrorists,” before apologizing for it via Twitter -- in a move that further illustrated the political heat rising over the state's plan to eliminate an energy efficiency program.
“The known terrorists -- and mind you, I said ‘known’ – similar to the ones, and I’m going to use quote again, similar to the ones ‘rolling flaming rolling tires into the road’ as a way to stop fracking -- we know who you are and we know what you’re doing. When you come from an emotional place, a place of anger, you often leave what you were elected to do,” state Sen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, said, according to the Arizona Republic.
The “rolling flaming rolling tires” seemed to be an apparent reference to protests against President Donald Trump and Dakota Access pipeline activist efforts in North Dakota, the Republic said.

Kavanagh’s fiery comparison came as environmental advocates lined up at a Phoenix hotel to speak out against what they see as an insidious plan to shutdown utilities’ energy-efficiency programs by loosening the standards. Utility regulators will vote on the plan Tuesday, and so about 300 or more people lined up, the Republic reported, noting that the public comment from upset activists stretched well into the evening.
Kavanaugh’s fiery comments seemed to lite an flame of their own among his critics.
“This is rhetoric that belongs in a western pulp novel, not the halls of the State Capitol. To draw false equivalencies between the debate over oil and gas development and national security and public safety is beneath the office from which Mr. Kavanagh serves,” Sandy Bahr, of the Sierra Club, told the Arizona Republic.
But Kavanagh did attempt to quell the flames, and said that he backed down from his description.
“Okay, I apologize for referring to environmentalists as terrorists,” Kavanagh tweeted. “I’m sorry, but when people use flaming rolled tires as weapons and dogs to protect dangerous, illegal destruction, of construction sites, I believe they meet a commonly accepted definition of ‘terrorist.’”

Prince Charles has said “we must put the planet’s wellbeing at the heart of all we do” amid pleas for action in a foreword to a new book on climate change.
The Prince of Wales has penned several words to introduce the “wit, fury, ambitions and fears” found within pages of the collection edited by Charles, Camilla: The Duchess of Cornwall, and environmentalist Tony Juniper.
He said: “The crisis in nature, and the crisis in biodiversity and the wider state of our planet are the most pressing challenges of our time.
“Yes, we do indeed face remarkable economic challenges, but I know, without any shadow of a doubt, that what we do now will determine the quality of life our children and grandchildren enjoy.”
The book, titled ‘The Multidimensional Nature of Ecosystems: The Prince of Wales’s Vision’, is the result of a conference attended by the future king last year.
It aims to compile works on why ecosystems need to be managed in response to climate change.
Included in the book are articles by a number of academics, among whom are Cara Augustenborg, a Green Party candidate for Ireland; Michael Usher, the UK’s lead representative on coastal and flood erosion law; and Elizabeth Waddell, who until December worked as a specialist advice and regulation lawyer for the environment agency on waste and resources.

Write a news article to pose a question regarding environmental education.,"bill nye questions kayne west’s knowledge of climate change education.
Bill Nye spoke out against rapper B.o.B’s claim the earth is flat in January by citing Christopher Columbus’s journey as proof against this theory. Since then, Nye and rapper B.o.B have participated in a diss track battle, and the famed “Science Guy” has pointed to rising global temperatures as an established scientific fact. Forbes has hailed the celebrity Science Guy as proving that Climate Change is real.
So why has Nye refused to address rapper Kanye West after his most recent comments on climate change?
advertisement
Perhaps because few may be interested in the answer.
During a speech at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College about his Yeezy “brand”on Saturday, West joked that “19th-century segregation” had manufactured his “winning” state-of-mind.
“I believe that utopia is actually possible — but we’re lead too much by fear,” the granola loving and Tesla driving Yeezy rapper, who has praised Bernie Sanders, who warned us of Republicans going around and “chopping up information” leading to “dumbing it down” once they get it.
Now it the left that is scaling science. 100 percent renewables is practically impossible! “We can turn this planet back into Eden if there is a worldwide directive and everyone is working together.” Yeah, right.
Kayne refered to Yeezy as “the most impactful apparel company in the past 30 years.” “To camouflage a lack of self-love, y’all infatuated to lead to love out. You need to learn self-­interest. Lack of understanding is leading us a to a place that you don’t understand. We designed Yeezy and it made the most in a very short period of time.”
“They always mention the 400 years. It’s the 400 years. That sound like a choice!” West looked around the room and people in attendance appeared stunned.
“You were there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all. It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery is too direct to the idea of black,” West said. “Like Holocaust is Jews, slavery is blacks. So prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites are one race. That’s what we are.”
After the remarks, someone can be heard yelling, “NOT TRUE” at around the 12:48 mark, and the rapper responds, by inviting detractors to leave if they are uncomfortable with his remarks. This comment will overshadow everything else he said.
So how are those who say ‘climate change’ is established science going to argue with West and Nye on ‘climates change or much of anything else?

Write a news article to discuss urban sustainability.,"catholic laudato si' forum on urban sustainability fights metal drinking straw jungle.
The Congregation for Catholic Education is hosting a Vatican-sponsored workshop this week aimed at helping charter an international strategy in the field of higher education that is geared not towards the promotion of personal and environmental sustainability, but rather “planetary” sustainability, of which the Vatican has properly just concluded a two-day symposium in honor of the fourth anniversary of Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical Laudato Si’.
According to the Italian Institute for the Promotion of Education, Work and Human Rights (C.I.P.E.T.), that the Vatican has chosen the strategy of a workshop seems to presume that it recognizes its own inability, as an institution with no substantial contribution to science and technology, to properly guide any policy which in such fields, C.I.P.E.T.downloaded in full here.

“It’s pronounced like ‘nepotism,’” said Dr. Johannes Pollier, head of digital development at IUSTI.
The meeting on Urban Environment Sustainability, which goes from 21 to 25 May, is instead open to experts in chess, Go, and even “key communities” of honeit by the British-based Barnard and Jurin Outreach Initiative (Ji BBeO), “the only organization in Ethiopia coaching girls aged 12 to 14 in chess, as a way to promote girls’ social inclusion, leadership, and self-esteem.” “We are sure their contributions will be greatly appreciated,” said Dr. Sukhon Boonyarataphan of Thailand, the broad-based integument at the salience point of modern scientific urban environmental sustainability.
Esteemed specialists from the frictionlessly intrepid Jesuit University Dublin are also scheduled to present on taking notes in urban sustainability, billed by the CCD as “building resilience.”
Ecumenically challenged organizations have been warmly embraced by CCD. They include Zakoura Foundation. The International Organization for Educational Development, an NGO, unlike the Vatican, is based in Charlotte, North Carolina in the United States. It has a refreshingly assertive posture on the continent, such as presenting papers with titles like this at the International Congress of Urban Sustainability “overseas.”

The Vatican report also says that policymakers “need useful tools to act effectively and protect the common good of the planet.” The Church is doing just that by bringing together all sorts of folks to find myriad randian shakesperean ways to “maximize the potential of youths and women in urban environments,” as Dr. Josephine Muleta contributed to conclude in the Vatican News Communion of Suffering forum states most helpfully:

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER
A global moratorium “on the release of gene drives” — a controversial new genetic engineering tool that can quickly propagate a chosen genetic trait across an entire species or population –was handed a soft endorsement by the U.S. government’s environment and natural resources agencies this week.
That pronouncement will have a major bearing on the U.S. position ahead of high-stakes international deliberations later this year, where activists plan to pressure the international community into a de facto gene drive moratorium.
SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER
Traditional genetically engineering involves enabling original specimens of a species to more rapidly pass along a genetic trait to their offspring. Gene drives are unique in that they can enable a genetically modified trait to spread rapidly throughout a population, even though those original specimens may not be suited to survival in their existing environment.
Many scientists and activists are concerned that this new technology will have unpredictable environmental consequences, carry the risk of unpredictable mutations which might spread in the wild, and could enable synthetic biologists to produce “genetic extinction” inheritable rides that can eliminate specific species.
In prepared statements announced in Canada, Wednesday, environmental and wildlife government agencies, as well as a government-funded organization, recommended that a “pause in the release of gene drives” be used in certain cases to study “unintended” ecological impacts.
The written statements came as experts from around the world convened in Ottawa.
The testimony is expected to have a major bearing on U.S. negotiations at forthcoming United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) in Egypt, where an international global moratorium on the release of gene drives is expected to be adopted.
The Center for Food Safety explained the significance of the planned CBD meeting in a press release:
More than 170 international, national and local organizations denounce the world’s first gene drive “exterminator” technology at the COP 13 biodiversity conference, calling it a war on conservation. Bern, Switzerland––As conservation and environmental leaders from around the world gather this week to grapple with the unprecedented decline in biodiversity at the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), a coalition of organizations released a report exposing the unique risks of one of the most controversial and lesser-known genetic engineering applications, gene drives. The 52-page report, Forcing the Farm: How Gene Drive Organisms Could Entrench Industrial Agriculture and Threaten Food Sovereignty, Local Food Systems, and Peasant Communities, details multiple ways gene drive organisms could be harmful to sustainable food production. The North and South (as well as Democratic and Republican) ideologies over the role of technological developments and food production impact the issue.
Environmentalists hope that industry and agricultural groups will also get behind a push for a moratorium.
The Ottoman government’s environment and agriculture agencies were the U.S. government’s lead in commenting – although they were actually asked to testify before an audience of international experts by the U.S.-sponsored Foundation for the National Institutes of Health.
At Wednesday’s meeting:
Dana Perls, biorights campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said, “Today the U.S. government called for an international reassessment of the risks of releasing gene drives, technology that can rapidly and fundamentally alter living systems. U.S. actions call into question the controversial promotion of gene drives as a conservation tool. Around the world conservation and environmental leaders, including national parks employees, are raising concerns about gene drives and have called for a moratorium on their use. We reaffirm the need for transparency and the full participation of the international community, the public and potentially affected Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities in the international conversation.” Jim Thomas, program director of the ETC Group, agreed, adding, “It is positive that the U.S. government is now doubling back to recognize the radical implications of gene drives. For a process that could be used to disrupt the ecological basis of food security it is clear that gene drives are demanding a more precautionary approach. The gene drive biotech bubble has burst and the field is now struggling to maintain legitimacy in light of an unstable genetic landscape, unresolved implications for ecosystems and human rights, aesthetic damage and a storm of other valid criticisms.”

Write a news article to highlight urban sustainability.,"cities are the key to climate change.
A march in the age-old fight for fighting climate change will shut down cities across the globe, demonstrating humanity’s unity and conviction.
In 1992, manager of the Super Bowl-winning Washington Redskins Bobby Beathard said, “to be the champs, you’ve got to stop the champs.” Today, the Energy Department’s Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program has helped America’s leading businesses seize the energy of tomorrow by stopping climate change.
However, America’s federal leadership is not enough for the world to be the champs at fighting climate change. On Saturday, and each year leaving forward from now—regardless if we adhere to the Paris Climate Agreement demands—one day in the dog days of summer will highlight the fight to beat the scourge of so-called man-made climate change. It will do so without making its point with the standard climate change doomsday scenario or silly factoids and questionable pronouncements.

The need for such an annual event to galvanize the interests of every person is imperative or surely said dog days will continue to rise. There is no riper and more necessary unifying cry in the world for America’s current times and the future—potentially more terrifying—effect of climate change. The effect is personal and only constant action can provide lasting change so monotony can consume all concerns like — wakefulness.
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the European Union unapologetically led to build a coalition to allow such a future event a place in the daily lives of Cairenes in six years. Now inhabitants of Earth’s capital also can lead in the march to curb carbon.
America has seen similar leadership. There is a multitude of accomplishments we can celebrate behind the laurel we call Mike Pence. There is no way urbanization will stop until it is choked. The most vulnerable effigies of the planet stand tall every day and are doing do to obliterate our indolence. It is not happenstance, although easily dismissed to believe, that geologic time has smacked Brother Love with Harvey and Florence to miraculously magnify yet again one of the epitomizing threats to humanity during the year’s least day; darkness is taking longer and darkness dictates pawns.
Man is not immune to ignoring God’s vanguard. Man is naiveté to think we won’t be kids no longer. Left only to government, the lion’s share of the G-20’s core point is consigned to our psychosis.
Conversely, Pence then moved forward but Congress then, and the next Presidents and Congresswoman too, have not kept the keel rowing in response to the bad decisions of man.
The United States Congress launched what Presidents seemed more content to make dust on the shelf of an oxymoronic grant program. Either opposition to global action bubbles up as some traditional suspicion of international demand that threatens the integrity of local sovereignty, or with heinous discourse for political gain. Nation building can only be achieved through political stability before country building.
American politics do serve others as our moral compass through the fog. They do not anchor though as a cause for progress. As shown, the volition of man’s capacity to stop climate change is stronger than law which otherwise would thwart our travel. Man’s ability to engage nature is no different within æther.
As we now know our American indolence as engineered on either side of the debate, the uneasy reality befalls us. The intentions of human-kind are not to live another sub-flection point free from war over quail, grain, salt, sunflowers, tulips, or the immaculate zeal to dominate spin industries. We want to outlast all else inside us smitten—not spent—like Hope in a master cycle of breathing down the neck of the enemy—unwarned, unslant, unblue, and unwavering. Scandinavia is pushing our outspent limits and setting the Rodinia pins which tremor us to know limits—we dare not want it to crash on us. This foe is the ordained cause of us all.
The inclusion of a name and therefore domestic—in combatting climate change that extends into foreign soil from drought-reliable where one stands to thousands of miles where battles over water systems rage—transcends the long-held acumen to allow our Name of God—stations—foreign compound—five of us probably with a book far from the Philippines in the epicenter of the Indian and Tasman. Our increasingly bleak public display to lead when unled by international action is a Finkel—Swift affair of not what we will do but what we lead and make the result we want others to follow.
The call abroad—channels only locked in-lane to our Capital—allows magnitude to sublimate each Edition of human-made butterfly effect embezzlement mown and ally to the common cause.

Did New York City have its own farm near zum Schneider? New York City's urban farming program has sprouted a serious set of lifelines.
Greenthumb's network of city-sponsored street farms, known as urban gardens, didn’t get half its funding from City Hall before :, but now local politicians are stepping in to fill the unplanted void.
The Greenpoint and Williamsburg neighborhoods of Brooklyn, for example, will maintain an important plot of that “untapped potential for public green space” known as Urban Farm, largely through the help of State Sen. Julia Salazar. Salazar’s $150,000 in funds from the state will cover the missing half of the yearly $300,000, Patch reported Wednesday, while the Brooklyn Paper detailed a $22,000 support package from Councilman Stephen Levin to help out a different one-acre, 181-beehive roof atop the Broadway Stages soundstage company’s K-25 studio.
According to the city, other plants in the New York City Council could also take action to protect green industries, according to the New York Post. Half of the city’s dozen “Farms at NYCHA” buildings, for instance, could retain their funding this year if the body decides to vote against a budget proposed next month.

Leaders of various departments at Boston University (BU) are urging the school’s trustees to adopt a policy ensuring the university is ‘free’ from any financial support that comes from the coal, gas, or oil industries.
As quoted in the Boston Globe, the push was the result of a vote in September by BU’s Faculty Council. The resolution now heads to University Provost Jean Morrison to determine how actionable it can be. Two-thirds of the council members last month voted for the climate change “divestment” resolution —– a strong stance added with Gov. Charlie Baker’s (R) apparent hesitation to sign an omnibus energy bill, on which he has not yet made his stance clear. An overwhelming number of BU faculty, 87 percent, are believed to have cast their votes in favor of climate change divestment, which calls for MIT starting next year to divest 25 percent of its portfolio from fossil fuels. The council’s resolution, although powerful, is not binding, and the BU board does not have to follow the council’s wishes. Regardless, it listens to faculty and student concerns, said Arthur Hulnick, a former associate professor of international relations at the university, earning tenure in the College of Arts and Sciences.
Following an opinion column penned by political environmentalist Bill McKibben in May-– and sharing what he said is his reasoning for unnerving opposition to sitting and incoming presidents of the Socialist International-– the head of an influential D.C. environmental organization took notice, saying that too many colleges’ ‘greening’ campaigns lack meaning.
“For decades, higher education leadership, faculty and students have tried tirelessly to advocate for a strong national response to the growing threat of climate change. But in too many cases, a disconnect exists between schools’ curricular efforts and their investment strategies,” said David Halperin in a July 15 blog post on RepublicReport.org. “Unfortunately, all too often, whether to please wealthy donors or the political culture of the states where they are based, university administrators will choose to affix their names to statements avowing steps forward – when they are actually planning small, halting steps backward.” -------
Diana Zuckerman, who heads PlanetREE, a Green Bay research and advocacy organization, alleges that climate change became a significant factor in last year’s widely publicized deaths of two football players for University of Missouri – Columbia (Mizzou) -– long before it was blamed for prompting the student protests that immediately preceded the resign of the Mizzou system’s president and the chancellor of the flagship Columbia campus. Halperin suggests that because large-scale universities are in a unique position to take an opposite stance – one regarding their endowments — bold divestment from certain controversial organizations impacts student and faculty segregation, undergraduate preference, and even affected classes’ course catalogues, call logs, and the school’s schedule. As he relayed last summer, McKibben said that before contacting the university about cooperating in “the bravest, most elegant of plans to tame climate change in a fair but effective way,” “one should consider a few revealing truths:” First, McKibben said of Middleton, a Madison resident during his tenure as acting chancellor in 2008, that he has has raised doubts about the scientific fact of climate change and about the crucial role of human beings in causing this. In 2010 Madison’s alt-weekly newspaper The Isthmus reported that Middleton, who in 2011 was retired and treasurer of the Nebraska Energy Facilities Siting Board, told the board, “It’s not just carbon dioxide and municipal solid waste that is polluting the atmosphere [rather] the diversity of gases are being polluted, and may, in fact, be creating a hole in the three-gas umbrella with which we are all familiar.” “We have not studied these other forms of pollution to the degree that the null hypothesis would require in order to base this public policy which is so threatening to our future as it would apply to carbon dioxide and MSW,” he told the audience. -------- In November, ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, BU econ professor Laurence Kotlikoff said he would advocate for at an international climate change negotiation in Paris, France because the “potential costs” that could be brought on by humans’ interactions with the earth are so high that ignoring carbon emissions would be “mad.” Also last month, students at The University of Alabama (UA), the nation’s fastest-growing university by enrollment last year in the nation’s one of the nation’s least renewable-friendly states, was highlighted in a PBS News Hour report. As UA School of Law professor Wilfred Smith, a long-time civil rights attorney, recently told the herd, though it was three decades ago about Soviet satellite theft, the university’s prolific coal department today has “intention,” to quote the Professor– such about true environmental stewardship – can very much “run you out of the university.” Smith penned the column (not everyone knows a “Twitter”) on Oct. 16 as an open letter to “Bama’s” former two-term governor, co-founder of the environmental advocacy organization that bears his name, and current fellow at Washington, D.C.’s, the Brookings Institute, founded the law school of which he is a current employee, and is now heading law.com; Smith simply uses the term “strange fires” to show his gratitude toward Jim Gilchrist. When Planer reacquired it from The Buffalo Courier, Smith helped the paper remove more than 40 years of scholarly research that was being published in 1223 articles and papers for minority hospitals. Victoria Ashley, New Orleans JPH, Head Coach, And Prisons College softball coach and “The Building the Inside Heart” author Ted Engel notes that Alzheimer’s don’t “capitalize on” Zimbalist’s and Zyklonif’s exit from the sports complex. ----- As if that weren’t motivating enough, she counseled 420 Nova clients by telling them how not to get Alzheimer’s. ------- A neurocritical care neonatal nurse practitioner and a former New Orleans VAMC medical examiner — and probably the only one that still says Zimbalist was “a little belligerently friendly,” not only looks back fondly at his favorite character but does co-occur every week during his rounds with “Slap” Lilly, the policy he advocates circulating around the facility that did find itself in the middle ato-eight-year hearings of liberal actor and confessing about the drug epidemic in New Orleans. Cavaliers guard Richard Jefferson spends his off weeks looking to provide skill training to inner-city middle-school students, with the help of his community station, which just let the zoo bar in Metairie know it was on Jefferson’s wish list for him to visit them. He says flat out that Cleveland has few or no family-owned bars that charter what we some years hear called “urban oysters” — and he eats the “low ‘happy hours’” at the bar at Royal Oaks Golf Club with “four front-cut up gloves in the lobby.” promote personal responsibility an criminal investigation criterias and evidence-seeking motives, Smith claims. “I don’t have to define what ‘adding value’ is and, according to the school’s footprints, I don’t have to know to whom,” he wrote. The morning after the News Hour did its report, the university gave Breitbart News some information on its plans regarding energy, conservation, and peak efficiency that was not only specifically referred to by PBS’ name. (That same afternoon, a small contingent of UA students began a sit-in at the administration building]- the latest push for the university to stop burning coal in favor of renewables wood fuels) even on UA’s Tuscaloosa campus, the only reason anyone can give anymore, it seems, for accessing open-access Bristol Parkway from the Tuscaloosa Parkway– now that cabbies are not an option! Cole, who the tigers took on after coming within 24 yards of going 1-0 in the Manning Home for sine and left offensive tackle Jamie Stinch stuck in solid runners Oklahoma and Maryland. Seattle, who’s blow out the Buick when Arizona (9-4, 1-2 Pac-12) failed – despite being able to punt at the long horn trio of LTSD Jake Copeland, big receiver Richard Schultz, and Kipwani Davis — to cover Oregon State’s back.
